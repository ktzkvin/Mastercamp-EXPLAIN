For example, the laser processing may be performed to the edge of the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130 of the cover window.</p><p id=\"p0111\" num=\"0111\">A laser 780 may be radiated along the first inclined part 320 and along the third inclined part 350. For example, the laser 780 may be radiated along the first part of the first inclined part 320 positioned at the edge of the plastic layer 110 and along the second part of the first inclined part 320 positioned at the edge of the first hard coating layer 120; and the laser 780 may be radiated along the first part of the third inclined part 350 positioned at the edge of the plastic layer 110 and along the second part of the third inclined part 350 positioned at the edge of the second hard coating layer 130. However, exemplary embodiments of the present invention are not limited thereto.

After the laser is first radiated to the first hard coating layer 120, the cover window may be turned over and the laser may be radiated to the second hard coating layer 130.</p><p id=\"p0113\" num=\"0113\">The laser processing may employ a carbon dioxide gas laser.<!-- EPO <DP n=\"19\"> --></p><p id=\"p0114\" num=\"0114\">Referring to <figref idref=\"f0014\">FIG. 14</figref>, the first horizontal part 330, the second inclined part 340, the second horizontal part 360, and the fourth inclined part 370 may be formed at the edge of the cover window by the laser 780.</p><p id=\"p0115\" num=\"0115\">A laser processing trace may remain at the first horizontal part 330, the second inclined part 340, the second horizontal part 360, and the fourth inclined part 370. For example, bubbles or craters may be found. A mechanical processing trace may remain at the vertical side part 310, the first inclined part 320, and the third inclined part 350. Before performing the laser processing, the mechanical processing trace may be at the edges of the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130.

For example, until the plastic layer 110 is at least exposed, the laser may be radiated to the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130. After the plastic layer 110 is exposed, if the laser is radiated to the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130, the second inclined part 340 and the fourth inclined part 370 may be formed at the plastic layer 110. If the laser is radiated to the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130, the plastic layer 110 might be exposed and the second inclined part 340 and the fourth inclined part 370 may be omitted (see, e.g., <figref idref=\"f0004\">FIG. 4</figref>).</p><p id=\"p0117\" num=\"0117\">The radiation intensity may be controlled by changing a power of the laser. The power of the laser may be set to be different depending on the thickness of the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130. For example, when the thickness of the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130 is from 0 µm to about 5 µm (up to 5 µm), the power of the laser may be from about 2.5 W to about 3.5 W. When the thickness of the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130 is from about 5 µm to about 10 µm, the power of the laser may be from about 3.0 W to about 4.0 W. When the thickness of the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130 is from about 10 µm to about 15 µm, the power of the laser may be from about 3.5 W to about 4.5 W.</p><p id=\"p0118\" num=\"0118\">When the thickness of the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130 is from about 15 µm to about 20 µm, the power of the laser may be from about 4.0 W to about 5.0 W. When the thickness of the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130 is from about 20 µm to about 25 µm, the power of the laser may be from about 4.5 W to about 5.5 W.

id=\"h0001\">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id=\"p0001\" num=\"0001\">The present disclosure relates to implantable screws. More particularly, the disclosure relates to implantable screws configured to provide compression upon a bone into which the screw is implanted.</p><heading id=\"h0002\">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id=\"p0002\" num=\"0002\">A broken bone must be carefully stabilized and supported until it is strong enough to handle the body's weight and movement. Until the last century, physicians relied on casts and splints to support and stabilize the bone from outside the body. The advent of sterile surgical procedures reduced the risk of infection, allowing doctors to internally set and stabilize fractured bones. During a surgical procedure to set a fracture, the bone fragments are first repositioned (reduced) into their normal alignment. They are held together with special implants, such as plates, screws, nails and wires.</p><p id=\"p0003\" num=\"0003\">Screws are used for internal fixation more often than any other type of implant. Although the screw is a simple device, there are different designs based on the type of fracture and how the screw will be used. Screws come in different sizes for use with bones of different sizes. Screws can be used alone to hold a fracture, as well as with plates, rods, or nails. After the bone heals, screws may be either left in place or removed.</p><p id=\"p0004\" num=\"0004\">In many instances, it is desired that the inserted screw provide compression at the bone joint or fracture line to reduce the incidence of nonunion (improper healing) and malunion (healing in improper position) of broken bones.</p><p id=\"p0005\" num=\"0005\"><patcit id=\"pcit0001\" dnum=\"WO2004069031A\"><text>WO2004/069031</text></patcit> describes a screw assembly according to the known art.</p><heading id=\"h0003\">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id=\"p0006\" num=\"0006\">To meet this and other needs, devices, systems for fixating bone are provided. In particular, bone screws are provided that apply compression to bone fragments or bone portions (for example, fixation of fractures or fusion of joints), are self-tapping and/or self-drilling, minimize or prevent screw toggle and/or back-out, remove bone build-up (for example, from cutting flutes), and the like.<!-- EPO <DP n=\"2\"> --></p><p id=\"p0007\" num=\"0007\">The invention is defined by the independent claim 1. Further advantageous aspects of the invention are set forth in the dependent claims</p><p id=\"p0008\" num=\"0008\">In at least one embodiment, a compression screw is provided for applying compression at a bone joint. The compression screw includes an axial screw body extending from a distal end to a proximal end with the distal end including a series of bone engaging threads configured to be self-drilling and self-tapping and the proximal end including a head which defines a radially extending shoulder. At least one proximal rotary cutting structure is defined proximally of the bone engaging threads.

Certain terminology is used herein for convenience only and is not to be taken as a limitation on the present invention. The following describes preferred examples and embodiments of the present invention. However, it should be understood, based on this disclosure, that the invention is not limited by the preferred embodiments described herein.</p><p id=\"p0022\" num=\"0022\">Devices, systems for fixating bone are provided. In particular, bone screws are provided that may apply compression to bone fragments or bone portions. This may be particularly effective, for example, in trauma applications for fixation of bone fractures and/or fusion of joints. The disclosed devices may be used for repairing bones including, but not limited to, the femur, tibia, fibula, humerus, ulna, radius, metatarsals, phalanx, phalanges, ribs, spine, vertebrae, clavicle, and other bones. Any of the features described herein may be applied to standalone screws or screws that additionally include a compression sleeve.</p><p id=\"p0023\" num=\"0023\">Referring to <figref idref=\"f0001\">Figs. 1-2</figref> and <figref idref=\"f0003\">8</figref>, a compression screw 10 in accordance with an embodiment will be described. The compression screw 10 generally comprises a bone screw 12 and a compression sleeve 30. The bone screw 12 and the compression sleeve 30 may be constructed from any biocompatible material including, but not limited to, stainless steel alloys, titanium, titanium based alloys, or polymeric materials.</p><p id=\"p0024\" num=\"0024\">The bone screw 12 includes a shaft 14 extending from a distal end 11 to a proximal end 13. Referring to <figref idref=\"f0001\">Figs. 2</figref> and <figref idref=\"f0003\">8</figref>, in the illustrated embodiment, a cannula 20 extends from the distal end 11 to the proximal end 13 such that a guide wire may be used for positioning the compression screw 10. A<!-- EPO <DP n=\"6\"> --> drive feature 22 is defined in the proximal end 13 of the shaft 14 and is configured and dimensioned to be any shape that corresponds with the end of the driving instrument designed to engage the bone screw 12. As an example, in the illustrated embodiment, the drive feature 22 has a hexalobular configuration.</p><p id=\"p0025\" num=\"0025\">A series of bone engaging threads 15 extend radially from the shaft 14 at the distal end 11 and a series of sleeve engaging threads 18 extend radially from the shaft 14 at the proximal end 13. In the preferred embodiment, the bone engaging threads 15 are dual lead thread type and the sleeve engaging threads 18 are a standard machine thread. However, any type of thread for either thread series 15, 18 may be used to facilitate the function of the compression screw 10. The bone screw 12 preferably also includes at least one cutting flute 16 configured to cut into the bone as the bone screw 12 is rotated, defining a self-drilling and self-tapping tip. In a preferred embodiment, a slot 17 is associated with each cutting flute 16 to clear any chips, dust, or debris generated when the compression screw 10 is implanted into bone tissue.</p><p id=\"p0026\" num=\"0026\">The compression sleeve 30 includes a tubular body 32 extending from a distal end 31 to a proximal end 31 with an internal passage 40 therethrough. The compression sleeve 30 includes a series of internal threads 39 (see <figref idref=\"f0003\">Fig. 8</figref>) configured to engage the sleeve engaging threads 18 of the bone screw 12 such that the bone screw 12 and the compression sleeve 30 are threadably adjustable to one another. The proximal end 33 of the compression sleeve 30 defines a radially extending head 34 which defines a shoulder 35 between the tubular body 32 and the head 34. A drive feature 42 is defined in the head 34 of the compression sleeve 30 and is configured and dimensioned to be any shape that corresponds with the end of the driving instrument designed to engage the compression sleeve 30. As an example, in the illustrated embodiment, the drive feature 42 has a hexalobular configuration.</p><p id=\"p0027\" num=\"0027\">As will be described in more detail hereinafter, during insertion of the implant, both drive features 22, 42 are engaged such that the compression screw 10 maintains its full length. After the tip of the bone screw 12 is at the desired depth, only the drive feature 42 in the compression sleeve 30 is actuated. Since the two components are connected via threads, actuation of only the compression sleeve 30 will act to move the compression sleeve 30 distally toward the tip of the bone screw 12, which shortens the length of the compression screw 10 and compresses the bone when the shoulder 35 of the compression sleeve 30 is on the near cortex.<!-- EPO <DP n=\"7\"> --></p><p id=\"p0028\" num=\"0028\">To facilitate such shortening of the compression screw 10, the distal end 31 of the compression sleeve 30 is provided with one or more cutting flutes 36 configured to cut into the bone as the compression sleeve 30 is rotated. The cutting flutes 36 simplify the procedure by removing material without the necessity of drilling to the outer diameter of the compression sleeve tubular body 32. This also allows the compression screw 10 to be adjusted to any length without the need to predrill to a desired depth to accommodate the compression sleeve 30. In the present embodiment, the cutting flutes 36 define a proximal rotary cutting structure.</p><p id=\"p0029\" num=\"0029\">In the alternative embodiment of the compression sleeve 30' illustrated in <figref idref=\"f0001\">Figs. 3 and 4</figref>, a slot 38 is associated with each cutting flute 36, with each slot recessed into the surface of the tubular body 32 and configured to guide the aforementioned cut bone into the slots 38. The mechanism of action for this technology relies on first the cutting flutes 36 to remove material from the substrate that it is being inserted into. This material then follows through the path of the slots 38 by one of two mechanisms: (1) path of least resistance (the material has nowhere else to go) or (2) the trajectory of the slots 38 roughly follows the pitch of the cutting flutes 36 as it is advanced into the bone, and thus the cutaway material stays close to its original position as the screw advances axially via the screw's helix.</p><p id=\"p0030\" num=\"0030\">The slots 38 serve two functions: (1) the cut bone that follows the slots 38 acts to enhance the fit between the native bone and the component being inserted into the bone and (2) allows for bony ingrowth to prevent dislodging of the compression screw 10. The cutting flutes 36 act to remove bone and guide said removed bone into the slots 38. This is in effect a self-grafting feature of the compression sleeve 30 which enhances purchase. Surgeons will sometimes remove bone and pack it back into the implant to enhance purchase, however, this configuration on the compression sleeve 30 does that for them. Enhanced purchase acts to prevent screw toggle and screw axial motion. Even if the slots 38 are not filled with bone, they can act to prevent both screw toggle and screw axial motion by providing a surface to catch on the native bone. Additionally, the slots 38 provide a surface for bony ingrowth which can also prevent screw toggle and screw axial motion.</p><p id=\"p0031\" num=\"0031\">While the trajectory of the slots 38 is shown in the embodiment of <figref idref=\"f0001\">Figs. 3 and 4</figref> to roughly follow the pitch of the cutting flutes 36, the slots may have other configurations. For example, in the compression sleeve 30\" illustrated in <figref idref=\"f0002\">Fig. 5</figref>, the slot 38' has a steeper trajectory than the pitch of the cutting flutes. <figref idref=\"f0002\">Fig. 6</figref> illustrates another embodiment of the compression sleeve 30''' wherein the slot<!-- EPO <DP n=\"8\"> --> 38\" has an even steeper trajectory, being substantially parallel to the axis of the compression sleeve 30'''. In addition to having different trajectories, the slots 38, 38', 38\" may have different pitches resulting in the slots being spaced closer together or further apart. Additionally, the slots 38, 38', 38\" may have different configurations, for example, semi-circular, semi-oval, v-shaped, square, rectangular or the like. Furthermore, while the combination of cutting flutes 36 and slots 38, 38', 38\" are illustrated in conjunction with the compression sleeve 30, it is recognized that such can be applied to a surface of any type of component that is being inserted into bone.</p><p id=\"p0032\" num=\"0032\">Having generally described the compression screw 10, an exemplary driver assembly 100 for inserting the compression screw 10 and an exemplary method of insertion will be described with reference to <figref idref=\"f0002\">Figs. 7</figref> and <figref idref=\"f0003\">8</figref>.</p><p id=\"p0033\" num=\"0033\">The driver assembly 100 has a bone screw driver 110 and a compression sleeve driver 120. The bone screw driver 110 includes a driver shaft 112 extending from a distal end 111 to a proximal end 113. A driver tip 114 is defined on the distal end 111 of the driver shaft 112 and is configured to engage the driver feature 22 of the bone screw 12. A connection key 115 is defined on the proximal end 113 of the driver shaft 112 and is configured to facilitate connection of the bone screw driver 110 to a manual or powered rotation device or a locking device which prevents rotation (not shown). A series of axial splines 116 extend radially from the driver shaft 112 and are configured to be selectively engaged by a connector switch 128 of the compression sleeve driver 120, as will be described in more detail hereinafter. A series of external threads 119 extend from the driver shaft 112 distally of the splines 116. The external threads 119 are configured to be selectively engaged by a thread engagement member 132 of the compression sleeve driver 120, as will be described in more detail hereinafter.</p><p id=\"p0034\" num=\"0034\">The compression sleeve driver 120 extends from a distal end 121 to a proximal end 123. The proximal end 121 is defined by a tubular body 125 with a driver tip 124 at the distal most end and an outward housing 130 proximally therefrom. The driver tip 124 is configured to engage the driver feature 42 of the compression sleeve 30. The housing 130 defines a radial chamber in which the thread engagement member 132 is radially moveable. Upon depression of the thread engagement member 132, internal threads thereof engage the external threads 119 of the driver shaft 112 such that the driver shaft 112 is caused to move axially with the compression sleeve driver 120 when they are rotated together as will be described.<!-- EPO <DP n=\"9\"> --></p><p id=\"p0035\" num=\"0035\">A handle member 126 extends proximally from the housing 130 to the proximal end 123. The connector switch 128 extends transversely through the handle member 126 and is moveable between a non-engaged position (see <figref idref=\"f0003\">Fig. 8</figref>) and an engaged position (see <figref idref=\"f0005\">Fig. 13</figref>). In the non-engaged position, an open area 129 of the connector switch 128 aligns with the splines 116 such that the switch 128 is not engaged with the splines 116 and the compression sleeve driver 120 rotates independent of the bone screw driver 110. In the engaged position, a contact portion 127 of the connector switch 128 engages the splines 116 such that rotation of the compression sleeve driver 120 causes simultaneous rotation of the bone screw driver 110.</p><p id=\"p0036\" num=\"0036\">To insert the compression screw 10, the driver assembly 100 is positioned such that the driver tip 114 of the shaft 112 engages with the drive feature 22 of the bone screw 12 and the driver tip 124 of the tubular body 125 engages with the drive feature 42 of the compression sleeve 30, as shown in <figref idref=\"f0003\">Fig. 8</figref>. During initial insertion, the connector switch 128 is moved to the engaged position such that the bone screw driver 110 and the compression sleeve driver 120 rotate together. The driver assembly 100 is rotated with both drivers 110, 120 rotating and thus the compression screw 10 is advanced as a single unit until the distal end 11 of the bone screw 12 is at a desired location. The thread engagement member 132 may be depressed during such rotation to ensure that the shaft 112 advances axially during the simultaneous rotation. If the distal end 31 of the compression sleeve 30 contacts bone as the compression screw 10 is advanced, the proximal rotary cutting structure, i.e. the cutting flutes 36, cut into the bone and the compression screw 10 is free to continue to advance as a single unit.</p><p id=\"p0037\" num=\"0037\">After the distal end 11 of the bone screw 12 has landed at the desired location, compression may be achieved by advancing the compression sleeve 30 while the bone screw 12 remains stationary. The bone screw 12 remains stationary by holding the bone screw driver 110 stationary, for example, by attaching a locking device to the connection key 115, and by disengaging the connector switch 128. With the connector switch 128 moved to the disengaged position, the compression sleeve driver 120 rotates freely about the bone screw driver 110. Rotation of the compression sleeve driver 120 causes the compression sleeve 30 to advance. Since the bone screw 12 is stationary as the compression sleeve driver 120 advances the compression sleeve 30, the compression screw 10 shortens in length and the shoulder 35 thus applies compression. Again, the cutting flutes 36 on the compression sleeve distal end 31 allow the compression sleeve 30 to cut into and advance into the bone.<!-- EPO <DP n=\"10\"> --></p><p id=\"p0038\" num=\"0038\">Referring to <figref idref=\"f0004\">Figs. 9-10</figref>, a compression screw 10' in accordance with another exemplary embodiment will be described. The compression screw 10' is substantially the same as the previous embodiment except with the addition of a self-countersinking head 34' on the compression sleeve 30<sup>iv</sup>. The self-countersinking head 34' has a tapered shoulder 35' and a series of external threads 37. The threads 37 are configured to be self-drilling and self-tapping. The self-countersinking head 34' is advantageous in that the head does not protrude from the near cortex, which minimizes soft-tissue irritation and can reduce the reoperation rate. In the present embodiment, the cutting flutes 36 and the threads 37 each define a proximal rotary cutting structure. In all other aspects, the compression screw 10' is the same as the previously described compression screw 10.</p><p id=\"p0039\" num=\"0039\">Referring to <figref idref=\"f0004 f0005\">Figs. 11-13</figref>, a driver assembly 100' and method for inserting the compression screw 10' will be described. The driver assembly 100' is substantially the same as in the previous embodiment except for the distal end 121' of tubular body 125' of the compression sleeve driver 120'. Instead of a driver tip, the distal end 121' defines an internally threaded chamber 122 which threadably engages the threads 137 of the self-countersinking head 34'.</p><p id=\"p0040\" num=\"0040\">To insert the compression screw 10', the driver assembly 100' is positioned such that the driver tip 114 of the shaft 112 engages with the drive feature 22 of the bone screw 12 and the threads 137 of the self-countersinking head 34' are threadably received in the threaded chamber 122 of the compression sleeve driver 120', as shown in <figref idref=\"f0005\">Fig. 13</figref>. During initial insertion, the connector switch 128 is moved to the engaged position such that the bone screw driver 110 and the compression sleeve driver 120' rotate together. The driver assembly 100' is rotated with both drivers 110, 120' rotating and thus the compression screw 10' is advanced as a single unit until the distal end 11 of the bone screw 12 is at a desired location. The thread engagement member 132 may be depressed during such rotation to ensure that the shaft 112 advances axially during the simultaneous rotation. If the distal end 31 of the compression sleeve 30<sup>iv</sup> contacts bone as the compression screw 10' is advanced, the cutting flutes 36 cut into the bone and the compression screw 10' is free to continue to advance as a single unit.</p><p id=\"p0041\" num=\"0041\">After the distal end 11 of the bone screw 12 has landed at the desired location, compression may be achieved by advancing the compression sleeve 30<sup>iv</sup> while the bone screw 12 remains stationary. The bone screw 12 remains stationary by holding the bone screw driver 110 stationary, for example, by attaching a locking device to the connection key 115, and by disengaging the connector switch 128. With the connector switch 128 moved to the disengaged position, the compression sleeve driver 120'<!-- EPO <DP n=\"11\"> --> rotates freely about the bone screw driver 110. Rotation of the compression sleeve driver 120' causes the compression sleeve 30<sup>iv</sup> to advance. Since the bone screw 12 is stationary as the compression sleeve driver 120' advances the compression sleeve 30<sup>iv</sup>, the compression screw 10' shortens in length and the shoulder 35' and distal end 121' of the compression sleeve driver 120' thus apply compression. Again, the cutting flutes 36 on the compression sleeve distal end 31 allow the compression sleeve 30 to cut into and advance into the bone.</p><p id=\"p0042\" num=\"0042\">After the desired amount of compression has been reached, the head 34' may be countersunk. Countersinking is done by a third driver component (not shown) that mates with the compression sleeve driver feature 42. For example, the driver assembly 100 may be exchanged for the driver assembly 100' such that the driver tip 124 can be used to rotate the compression sleeve 30<sup>iv</sup> while the bone screw 12 is maintained stationary. As the compression sleeve 30<sup>iv</sup> advances over the bone screw 12, the threads 37 cut into the bone and advance the head 34' into a countersunk position within the bone.</p><p id=\"p0043\" num=\"0043\">Referring to <figref idref=\"f0006\">Figs. 14-16</figref>, a compression screw 50 in accordance with another embodiment will be described. The compression screw 50 includes a shaft 52 extending from a distal end 51 to a proximal end 53. A series of bone engaging threads 55 extend radially from the shaft 52 at the distal end 51. In the preferred embodiment, the bone engaging threads 55 are dual lead thread type, however, any type of thread may be used to facilitate the function of the compression screw 50. The distal end 51 preferably also includes at least one cutting flute 56 configured to cut into the bone as the compression screw 12 is rotated, defining a self-drilling and self-tapping tip. In a preferred embodiment, a slot 57 is associated with each cutting flute 56 to clear any chips, dust, or debris generated when the compression screw 50 is implanted into bone tissue.</p><p id=\"p0044\" num=\"0044\">The proximal end 53 of the shaft 52 includes a self-countersinking head 54. The self-countersinking head 54 has a tapered shoulder 68 and a series of external threads 64. The threads 64 may include one or more cutting flutes 66 such that the threads 64 are self-drilling and self-tapping. In the present embodiment, the threads 64 define a proximal rotary cutting structure. A drive feature 62 is defined in the proximal end 53 of the shaft 52 and is configured and dimensioned to be any shape that corresponds with the end of the driving instrument designed to engage the compression screw 50. As an example, in the illustrated embodiment, the drive feature 62 has a hexalobular configuration.<!-- EPO <DP n=\"12\"> --></p><p id=\"p0045\" num=\"0045\">The shaft 52 between the bone engaging threads 55 and the head 54 is preferably free of threads. With this configuration, a difference in pitch between the bone engaging threads 55 and the threads 64 of the head 54 can provide additional compression control as the compression screw 50 is inserted. That is, if the pitch of the bone engaging threads 55 is larger than the pitch of the threads 64 of the head 54, and the fracture or joint line lies somewhere in the shaft 52 section of the screw 50, this configuration will provide compression between the two bones as the distal end 51 tries to advance faster than the head 54 of the screw 50.</p><p id=\"p0046\" num=\"0046\">Referring to <figref idref=\"f0007\">Figs. 17 and 18</figref>, a driver assembly 150 which allows the surgeon to further control how much compression is achieved will be described. The driver assembly 150 includes an inner driver member 152 and an outer driver member 160. The inner driver member 152 extends from a distal end 151 to a proximal end 153. A driver tip 154 is defined on the distal end 151 and is configured to engage the driver feature 62 of the compression screw 50.</p><p id=\"p0047\" num=\"0047\">The outer driver member 160 includes a tubular body extending from a distal end 161 to a proximal end 163. The distal end 161 defines a threaded chamber 164 configured to threadeably receive the threads 64 of the compression screw head 54.</p><p id=\"p0048\" num=\"0048\">To insert the compression screw 50, the driver assembly 50 is positioned with the driver tip 154 engaged with the driver feature 62 and the threads 64 of the head 54 threadably received in the threaded chamber 164. The inner and outer driver members 152, 160 are rotated such that the compression screw 50 is advanced. As the compression screw 50 advances, the distal end 161 of the outer driver member 160 will hit the near cortex and compress the fracture line as the screw 50 is continued to be inserted.</p><p id=\"p0049\" num=\"0049\">After the desired amount of compression has been reached, the inner driver member 152 is rotated, independent of the outer driver member 160, such that the compression screw 50 continues to advance with the outer driver member distal end 161 maintaining the compression. As the compression screw 50 advances, the threads 64 of the head 54 will enter the bone and begin to countersink the head 54. As the head 54 advances and countersinks, it simultaneously threads out of the threaded chamber 164. As explained before, the pitch of the bone engaging threads 55 and the threads 64 of the head 54 may be configured such that countersinking of the head 54 causes additional compression.</p><p id=\"p0050\" num=\"0050\">These and other advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing specification.

However in use of the clothes dryer, matters on the clothes such as dust and fluff flow along with air and accumulate on the multi-channel evaporator, making it difficult to clean the multi-channel evaporator. Coupled with that water condenses on a surface of the multi-channel evaporator and water, dust and fluff tend to be solidified on the surface of the multi-channel evaporator, a resistance of heat transfer between the fin and air is increased, and a heat transfer coefficient of the multi-channel evaporator is reduced, moreover a wind resistance of an air duct of the clothes dryer is increased and a circulating air rate is reduced, which are adverse to an improvement of working efficiency of the clothes dryer.</p><p id=\"p0004\" num=\"0004\">An application <patcit id=\"pcit0001\" dnum=\"US20090223077A1\"><text>US 2009/0223077 A1</text></patcit> relates to a domestic appliance for the care of washed articles which includes a container for receiving the washed articles.

After heat exchange, the refrigerant may return to the compressor 31 from the return gas inlet 312, and after compression by the compressor 31, the refrigerant may be discharged out from the gas outlet 311.</p><p id=\"p0087\" num=\"0087\">One end of the condenser 32 is connected to the gas outlet 311 of the compressor 31, the other end of the condenser 32 is connected to the throttling element 33, thus, the refrigerant discharged out from the gas outlet 311 of the compressor 31 may flow to the condenser 32, and the refrigerant exchanges heat with the surrounding air in the condenser 32 so as to raise the temperature of the surrounding air, subsequently the refrigerant flows to the throttling element 33 which throttles the refrigerant and reduces the pressure of the refrigerant.</p><p id=\"p0088\" num=\"0088\">As shown in <figref idref=\"f0004\">Fig. 8</figref>, the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 are in parallel connection. Specifically, the throttling element 33 is connected to one end of the tube-fin evaporator 35 and one end of the multi-channel evaporator 34 at the same time, and the return gas inlet 312 is connected to the other end of the tube-fin evaporator 35 and the other end of the multi-channel evaporator 34 at the same time. The refrigerant at high temperature and high pressure discharged out from the gas outlet 311 of the compressor 31 flows to the condenser 32, and the refrigerant exchanges heat with the surrounding air in the condenser 32 so as to raise the temperature of the surrounding air. After heat exchange, the refrigerant flows to the throttling<!-- EPO <DP n=\"31\"> --> element 33, and after throttling and pressure reduction by the throttling element 33, the refrigerant then flows to the tube-fin evaporator 35 and the multi-channel evaporator 34 at the same time. The refrigerant exchanges heat with the surrounding air in the tube-fin evaporator 35 and the multi-channel evaporator 34 so as to condense the water vapor in the surrounding wet air, and subsequently the refrigerant is discharged out from the tube-fin evaporator 35 and the multi-channel evaporator 34 and returns to the compressor 31 through the return gas inlet 312 of the compressor 31, so as to form the refrigerant circulation. The air in the air duct 2 becomes hot air after exchanging heat with the condenser 32 and flows into the drying cavity through the return air inlet 11 so as to dry the clothes, towels and the like in the drying cavity, the hot air takes the moisture in the clothes, towels and the like away and becomes wet air which is discharged out from the air outlet 12. The wet air discharged out from the air outlet 12 firstly runs through the tube-fin evaporator 35 and exchanges heat with the tube-fin evaporator 35, and subsequently continues to flow through the multi-channel evaporator 34 and exchanges heat with the multi-channel evaporator 34, so as to condense the water vapor in the wet air, and then the dry air continues to flow to the condenser 32, so as to form the circulation in the air duct.</p><p id=\"p0089\" num=\"0089\">The resistance element 351 is in series connection with the tube-fin evaporator 35 so as to increase the flow resistance of the refrigerant. As shown in <figref idref=\"f0004\">Fig. 8</figref>, the resistance element 351 is located at the outlet side of the tube-fin evaporator 35. Specifically, when the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 are in parallel connection, the refrigerant in the multi-channel evaporator 34 has a flow resistance different from that in the tube-fin evaporator 35. In general, the refrigerant in the multi-channel evaporator 34 has a flow resistance greater than that in the tube-fin evaporator 35, and as the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 are in parallel connection, the refrigerant flux in the multi-channel evaporator 34 is lower. The resistance element 351 is configured to reduce the refrigerant flux in the tube-fin evaporator 35, so that the refrigerant fluxes in the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 are equilibrated, thereby further optimizing the effects of heat exchange in the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35.</p><p id=\"p0090\" num=\"0090\">Specifically, the resistance element 351 is configured as a capillary tube, a counterbalance valve, a pressure regulating valve or an electronic expansion valve, thus the structure is simple and reliable.</p><p id=\"p0091\" num=\"0091\">Specifically, the water container (not shown in the drawings) is disposed under the<!-- EPO <DP n=\"32\"> --> multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35, so as to collect the condensed water generated by the wet air running through the tube-fin evaporator 35 and the multi-channel evaporator 34. The water tank is disposed above the tube-fin evaporator 35 and the multi-channel evaporator 34. Water in the water container may flow into the water tank, and when the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 need to be cleaned, water in the water tank may be sprayed on the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 under the action of gravity, so as to clean the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35.</p><p id=\"p0092\" num=\"0092\">The fan may blow the air in the air duct 2 to the condenser 32 so as to expedite the heat exchange between the condenser 32 and the air, so that after heat exchange, the air can conveniently flow to the drying cavity through the return air inlet 11, thereby improving the drying efficiency of the clothes dryer 100.</p><p id=\"p0093\" num=\"0093\">Specifically, both the flowing directions of the refrigerant in the tube-fin evaporator 35 and in the multi-channel evaporator 34 are reverse to the flowing direction of the air in the air duct 2, which facilitates improvement of the effect of the heat exchange between the air and the tube-fin evaporator 35 and between the air and the multi-channel evaporator 34.</p><p id=\"p0094\" num=\"0094\">The multi-channel evaporator 34 is disposed obliquely with respect to the horizontal plane, so that the multi-channel evaporator 34 is easy to clean.</p><p id=\"p0095\" num=\"0095\">Specifically, the multi-channel evaporator 34 is configured as the parallel flow multi-channel evaporator 34 or the snakelike multi-channel evaporator 34, thus the structure is simple and reliable.</p><p id=\"p0096\" num=\"0096\">In the present invention, unless specified or limited otherwise, a structure in which a first feature is \"on\" or \"below\" a second feature may include an embodiment in which the first feature is in direct contact with the second feature, and may also include an embodiment in which the first feature and the second feature are not in direct contact with each other, but are contacted via an additional feature formed therebetween.

To fulfill this requirement, a diplexer is used.</p><p id=\"p0003\" num=\"0003\">A diplexer is constituted by: converter sections which are interfaces for connection with a transmitter circuit, a receiver circuit, and an antenna circuit; directional coupler sections for coupling between a first waveguide and a second waveguide; and filters that determine a frequency band of high frequency signals to be passed.</p><p id=\"p0004\" num=\"0004\"><!-- EPO <DP n=\"2\"> --> For example, Non-Patent Literature 1 discloses techniques for realizing a diplexer, in Figure 18.35 thereof. Specifically, Non-Patent Literature 1 discloses combining (1) a filter pair constituted by two band-pass filters (\"Rx filter\" in Figure 18.35) arranged next to each other, (2) a directional coupler section (\"90° hybrid\" in Figure 18.35) provided on a first side of the filter pair, and (3) a directional coupler section (\"90° hybrid\" in Figure 18.35) provided on a second side of the filter pair.</p><p id=\"p0005\" num=\"0005\">In this diplexer, the directional coupler section on the first side includes an antenna port and a Tx port, and the directional coupler section on the second side includes an Rx port.

FDD involves transmitting outgoing waves simultaneously with reception of incoming waves. In devices that employ FDD, such as radio communication equipment and radar devices, insufficient isolation between the Tx port and the Rx port means that incoming waves will be buried by the outgoing waves. In other words, the receiver circuit will be unable to process the incoming waves. This is because the strength of incoming waves received by the antenna is much lower than the strength of outgoing waves transmitted by the transmitter circuit.</p><p id=\"p0008\" num=\"0008\">An object of an aspect of the present invention lies in achieving greater isolation between (i) a port which can be used as a Tx port and (ii) a port which can be used as an Rx port in a diplexer that includes ports which can be used as an antenna port, a Tx port, and an Rx port.</p><heading id=\"h0007\">Solution to Problem</heading><p id=\"p0009\" num=\"0009\"><!-- EPO <DP n=\"4\"> --> In order to solve the above problem, a diplexer in accordance with an aspect of the present invention includes: a filter pair constituted by (i) a first filter including a first port and a second port and (ii) a second filter including a first port and a second port, the first filter and the second filter each having a passband that is a first frequency band, the first filter and the second filter being arranged next to each other; a first directional coupler section including a first port and a second port arranged next to each other and a third port and a fourth port arranged next to each other, the first port of the first directional coupler section being connected to the first port of the first filter, the second port of the first directional coupler section being connected to the first port of the second filter; a second directional coupler section including a first port and a second port arranged next to each other and a third port and a fourth port arranged next to each other, the first port of the second directional coupler section being connected to the second port of the first filter, the second port of the second directional coupler section being connected to the second port of the second filter; and a third filter having a passband that is a second frequency band differing from the first frequency band, the third filter including a first port and a second port, the first port of the third filter being connected to the third port of the first directional coupler section.<!-- EPO <DP n=\"5\"> --></p><heading id=\"h0008\">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id=\"p0010\" num=\"0010\">An aspect of the present invention makes it possible to achieve greater isolation between (i) a port which can be used as a Tx port and (ii) a port which can be used as an Rx port in a diplexer that includes ports which can be used as an antenna port, a Tx port, and an Rx port.</p><heading id=\"h0009\">Brief Description of Drawings</heading><p id=\"p0011\" num=\"0011\"><ul id=\"ul0001\" list-style=\"none\" compact=\"compact\"><li><figref idref=\"f0001\">Fig. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a diplexer in accordance with Embodiment 1 of the present invention.</li><li>(a) <figref idref=\"f0002\">Fig. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a first connection example in the diplexer of <figref idref=\"f0001\">Fig. 1</figref>. <figref idref=\"f0002\">(b) of Fig. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a second connection example in the diplexer of <figref idref=\"f0001\">Fig. 1</figref>.</li><li><figref idref=\"f0003\">Fig. 3</figref> is a perspective view illustrating a diplexer in accordance with Embodiment 2 of the present invention.</li><li><figref idref=\"f0004\">Fig. 4</figref> is a plan view illustrating the diplexer in accordance with Embodiment 2 of the present invention.</li><li>(a) of <figref idref=\"f0005\">Fig. 5</figref> is a plan view of a converter section included in the diplexer in accordance with Embodiment 2 of the present invention.

the current channel, thus, the EPG can be displayed completely without switching to the barker channel; and on the other hand, since the broadcast program of the current channel is still played after the user enters the EPG, the effects that the content of the broadcast program does not change after the user enters the EPG, and the short black screen phenomenon is avoided during entering and exiting of the EPG are ensured.<!-- EPO <DP n=\"5\"> --></p><heading id=\"h0004\"><b>Brief Description of the Drawings</b></heading><p id=\"p0021\" num=\"0021\">In order to more clearly illustrate the

Obviously, the described embodiments are only a part of the embodiments of the present disclosure, but not all of the embodiments. All other embodiments obtained by those ordinarily skilled in the art without making creative efforts based on the embodiments in the present disclosure fall within the protection scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id=\"p0023\" num=\"0023\">In a scenario, when broadcast program information of channels needs to be obtained, since the broadcast program information of some channels is displayed on barker channels corresponding to the channels, a user must enter the barker channels to obtain the broadcast program information. Therefore, when a user enters an EPG, the user switches to the corresponding barker channels to obtain the corresponding broadcast program information on these channels at first, and then the EPG is displayed; when the user exits the EPG, the channel chose by the user before the user enters the EPG is restored. In this way, the broadcast program information of these channels can be obtained to display it on the EPG, but the channel switching action during entering and exiting of the EPG will cause bad user experience. For example, the content of a broadcast program played after the user enters the EPG has been changed; or obvious black screen phenomenon for a certain time (for example, about 2 seconds) is caused by the channel switching action when entering or exiting the EPG<!-- EPO <DP n=\"6\"> --></p><p id=\"p0024\" num=\"0024\">Therefore, embodiments of the present disclosure provide a method for displaying an EPG user interface and a device. The following description takes a smart TV as an example of a display device to discuss the embodiments of the present disclosure in detail.</p><p id=\"p0025\" num=\"0025\"><figref idref=\"f0001\">Fig.1</figref> is a schematic diagram of a smart TV. As shown in <figref idref=\"f0001\">Fig.1</figref>, the smart TV may include a tuner 101, a user interface 102, a system controller 103, a memory 104, an EPG generator 105, a video display processor 106, a display screen 107 and the like. The tuner 101 is configured to tune broadcast channels according to a user operation on the user interface 102 and control of the system controller 103; the memory 104 is configured for storing EPG information extracted from additional information contained in a digital broadcast signal or an analog broadcast signal received from the tuner 101; the EPG generator 105 may include an on screen display (OSD) generator and is configured for generating an EPG based on the EPG information stored in the memory 104; and the display screen 107 is used for displaying the EPG processed by the video display processor 106.</p><p id=\"p0026\" num=\"0026\">Specifically, in the process of displaying a TV broadcast program on the display screen 107 of the smart TV, the tuner 101 receives a broadcast signal, and a decoder (not shown) extracts EPG information from the received broadcast signal and outputs the extracted EPG information to an internal bus; and thus, the system controller stores the EPG information output to the internal bus in the memory 104 for displaying the EPG user interface.</p><p id=\"p0027\" num=\"0027\">When an EPG display request signal sent from a user through the user interface 102 (such as a remote control) is input to the system controller 103, for example, by pressing an EPG button on the remote control, that is, in response to the EPG display request sent from the user, the system controller 103 controls to read the EPG information from the memory 104, so that the EPG generator 105 can construct an EPG based on the read EPG information and EPG images generated by the OSD generator with pre-stored image data, and then the EPG user interface is displayed on the display screen 107 through the video display processor 106.</p><p id=\"p0028\" num=\"0028\">The broadcast signal is called a TS signal, and a data portion, different from an audio/video portion, of the TS signal is reconstructed to form a program information table. The program information table includes broadcast program information such as a program association table (PAT), a program mapping table (PMT), a network information table (NIT) and an event information table (EIT). The EIT stores multiple events, namely the above-mentioned extracted EPG information, which may include start time and end time of a broadcast program, and multiple descriptor fields, such as a short event descriptor field identifying a program name of the broadcast program, an extended event descriptor field identifying lead roles, screenwriters, profile and other information of the broadcast program, and a component descriptor field identifying the program type of the broadcast program.<!-- EPO <DP n=\"7\"> --></p><p id=\"p0029\" num=\"0029\">For example: in some embodiments, display of the EPG user interface on the display screen is shown in <figref idref=\"f0001\">Fig.2</figref>, an area 21 in the EPG user interface shows a broadcast program menu of five channels (DC a-DC e) playing between 3:00 PM and 5:00 PM, broadcast programs of each channel are displayed on a line according to the program play time: broadcast programs a0-a3 of a DC a channel, broadcast programs b0-b5 of a DC b channel, broadcast programs c0-c6 of a DC c channel, broadcast programs d0-d8 of a DC d channel, and broadcast programs e0-e7 of a DC e channel. An area 22 shows details of a selected broadcast program, such as the channel name, program name, play time, program type and content profile of the a2 broadcast program. An area 23 shows a broadcast program of the channel being watched before entering an EPG, for example, the broadcast program a1 which is being watched on the DC a channel at 3:50 pm.</p><p id=\"p0030\" num=\"0030\">However, since the EPG information of some channels is on the corresponding barker channels, if a user wants to obtain the EPG information of these channels, the user has to enter the barker channels, otherwise the user cannot obtain the EPG information. Therefore, when the user presses an EPG button on a remote control, the smart TV first needs to switch to the corresponding barker channel to obtain the corresponding EPG information of the channel, and thus, when the EPG is displayed, the broadcast program of the barker channel can be played in the window of the area 23 in <figref idref=\"f0001\">Fig.2</figref>; and when the user presses a back button on the remote control, the smart TV exits from the EPG and is redirected to the channel before entering the EPG In this way, the EPG information of these channels can be obtained to display the EPG, but the channel switching action when entering and exiting from the EPG will cause undesirable user experience to the user. For example, the content of the broadcast programs played before and after entering the EPG is inconsistent, or obvious nearly 2-second black screen is caused due to the slow channel switching action when entering and exiting from the EPG</p><p id=\"p0031\" num=\"0031\">In view of the above problem, as shown in <figref idref=\"f0002\">Fig.3</figref>, an embodiment of the present disclosure provides a method for displaying an EPG user interface applied to a smart TV, wherein the method includes the following steps.<ul id=\"ul0013\" list-style=\"none\" compact=\"compact\"><li>31. Displaying a broadcast program of a current channel on a display screen.</li><li>32. Receiving an input instruction for displaying the EPG user interface.</li><li>33. Determining whether the current channel has a corresponding barker channel in response to the input instruction; if it is determined that the current channel has a corresponding barker channel, the method goes to 34; otherwise, the method goes to 35.</li><li>34. Determining whether the current channel and the barker channel corresponding to the current channel are at a same frequency point; if it is determined that the current channel and the barker channel are at the same frequency point, the method goes to 35; otherwise, the<!-- EPO <DP n=\"8\"> --> method goes to 36.</li><li>35. Displaying the EPG user interface, and displaying a broadcast program of the current channel in a window of the EPG user interface.</li></ul></p><p id=\"p0032\" num=\"0032\">While a user is watching the broadcast program of a channel, when a smart TV receives an EPG display request signal sent from the user through a remote control, a system controller first determines whether the current channel has a corresponding barker channel.</p><p id=\"p0033\" num=\"0033\">Here, related information of the barker channel is recorded in the NIT of a program information table. For example, in the \"linkage_descriptor\" in the NIT shown in <figref idref=\"f0003\">Fig.4</figref>, a descriptor field \"Transport_stream_id\" indicates the channel identifier corresponding to the barker channel is 0x44D (1101), while in the PMT table shown in <figref idref=\"f0003\">Fig.4</figref>, the channel identifier corresponding to the barker channel is RTP1, that is, the RTP1 channel has a corresponding barker channel.</p><p id=\"p0034\" num=\"0034\">Then, according to the above example process, after it is determined that the current channel has a corresponding barker channel, whether the current channel and the corresponding barker channel are at the same frequency point is further determined next. When it is determined that the current channel and the corresponding barker channel are at the same frequency point, since all event information at the frequency point (a frequency point may correspond to multiple channels) of the current channel has been obtained when entering the current channel play, that is, the event information of the current channel has already been obtained from the frequency point of the current channel, thus the system controller can directly read all event information at the frequency point in the memory, and other event information in the memory except for the event information at the frequency point, and cause an EPG generator to generate a EPG user interface, the EPG user interface after being processed by a video display processor is displayed on the broadcast program image of the current channel on the display screen, so as to ensure a full display of the EPG user interface; and meanwhile, the system controller does not need to call a switch interface of the display device (for example, a smart TV channel-switch interface) to switch the current channel to the corresponding barker channel, therefore, the broadcast program of the current channel will continue being played in the window of the area 23 in the EPG user interface to ensure that the content of the broadcast program remains unchanged after entering the EPG, and short black screen due to the low switching speed when entering the EPG is avoided.</p><p id=\"p0035\" num=\"0035\">If it is determined that there is no barker channel corresponding to the current channel, that is, the event information of the current channel can be obtained from the corresponding frequency point, the system controller directly reads all event information at the frequency point of the current channel in the memory, and other EIT information in the memory except for all<!-- EPO <DP n=\"9\"> --> event information at the frequency point of the current channel, and cause the EPG generator to generate an EPG user interface, and the EPG user interface after being processed by the video display processor is displayed on the broadcast program image of the current channel on the display screen. Meanwhile, the window in the area 23 of the EPG user interface continues playing the broadcast program of the current channel.</p><p id=\"p0036\" num=\"0036\">36. Displaying the EPG user interface, and displaying a broadcast program of a barker channel corresponding to the current channel in a window of the EPG user interface.</p><p id=\"p0037\" num=\"0037\">When it is determined that the current channel has a corresponding barker channel, and the current channel and the corresponding barker channel do not belong to the same frequency point, since the event information of the current channel is obtained after entering the corresponding barker channel, the system controller calls the smart TV channel switch interface to switch the current channel to the corresponding barker channel, event information of the current channel is obtained, thus, the EPG generator is enabled to generate an EPG user interface based on the event information of the current channel and other event information in the memory, and the EPG user interface after being processed by the video display processor is displayed on the broadcast program image of the current channel on the display screen, so that a full display of the EPG user interface is ensured; and meanwhile, a broadcast program of the switched barker channel is played in the window in the area 23 of the EPG user interface.</p><p id=\"p0038\" num=\"0038\">After receiving an input instruction for exiting from the EPG user interface, the broadcast program of the current channel is displayed on the display screen in response to the input instruction.</p><p id=\"p0039\" num=\"0039\">After the smart TV receives the EPG exit request signal sent from the user through the remote control, the system controller controls the EPG user interface to exit and back to play the broadcast program of the current channel.</p><p id=\"p0040\" num=\"0040\">In a specific implementation process, a first variable may be defined to record whether the TV needs to be switched to the barker channel when entering the EPG user interface, and is set to false by default, that is, the TV does not need to switch to the barker channel; a second variable may be defined to record the channel to be returned when exiting from the EPG user interface.</p><p id=\"p0041\" num=\"0041\">In some examples, the broadcast program a1 of the DC a channel shown in <figref idref=\"f0001\">Fig.2</figref> is being played currently. When entering an EPG user interface, it is first determined whether the DC a channel has a corresponding barker channel. If there is such a corresponding barker channel, then it is further determined whether the DC a channel and the corresponding barker channel are at the same frequency point.</p><p id=\"p0042\" num=\"0042\">If the DC a channel and the corresponding barker channel are at the same frequency<!-- EPO <DP n=\"10\"> --> point, then the first variable is kept as false, and the EPG user interface is displayed according to the event information read from the frequency point where the DC a channel belongs, wherein the window of the EPG user interface plays the broadcast program a1 of the DC a channel, as shown in the window of the area 23 in <figref idref=\"f0001\">Fig.2</figref>. If the DC a channel and the corresponding barker channel are not at the same frequency point, then the first variable is set to be true, and the channel switch interface is called to switch to the barker channel; meanwhile, the channel identifier (for example channel id) of the DC a channel is recorded in the second variable in case the DC a channel needs to be switched back according to the channel identifier when exiting the EPG user interface; and the EPG user interface is displayed according to the event information of the barker channel, the window of the EPG user interface plays the broadcast program of the barker channel, as shown in the window of the area 23 in <figref idref=\"f0004\">Fig. 5</figref>.</p><p id=\"p0043\" num=\"0043\">If no corresponding barker channel exists, the EPG user interface is directly displayed according to the event information read from the frequency point where the DC a channel belongs, and a broadcast program a1 of the DC a channel is played in a window of the EPG user interface, as shown in a window of the area 23 in <figref idref=\"f0001\">Fig.2</figref>.</p><p id=\"p0044\" num=\"0044\">When exiting the EPG user interface, whether the first variable is false is determined at first. If the first variable is false, the TV goes back directly to the current channel. If the first variable is true, the channel switch interface is called to switch back to the current channel indicated by the channel identifier according to the channel identifier recorded in the second variable after exiting from the EPG user interface; and after the TV is successfully switched to the current channel, the first variable is set to be false.</p><p id=\"p0045\" num=\"0045\">In order to implement the above method, the present disclosure provides a display device, wherein the device includes:<ul id=\"ul0014\" list-style=\"none\" compact=\"compact\"><li>a display screen for displaying broadcast programs of a current channel;</li><li>a memory configured to store computer instructions and data associated with display content of the display screen;

When the thickness of the first coating layer is from about 20 µm to about 25 µm, the power of the laser may be from about 4.5 W to about 5.5 W.A second coating layer may be formed on a lower surface of the plastic layer.Mechanical processing may be performed on an edge of the second coating layer.Laser processing may be performed to the edge of the second coating layer after performing the mechanical processing.Shapes of the first coating layer and the second coating layer may be formed to be substantially symmetrical.According to an exemplary embodiment, after performing the mechanical processing, the cover window may undergo laser processing such that a bending ability and an impact resistance of the cover window may be increased.The above and other features of the inventive concept will become more apparent by describing in detail exemplary embodiments thereof, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a cover window according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 2 is a partially cut-away perspective view of an edge of a cover window according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of an edge of a cover window according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view of an edge of a cover window according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 5 is a cross-sectional view of an edge of a cover window according to an example useful for understanding of the present invention.FIG. 6 is a flowchart showing a manufacturing method of a cover window according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 7 to FIG. 11 are perspective views showing a manufacturing method of a cover window according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 12 to FIG. 14 are cross-sectional views showing a shape processing process of a cover window according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.FIG. 15 is a view showing an edge of a cover window according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention after mechanical processing.FIG. 16 is a view showing an edge of a cover window according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention after laser processing.Figure 17 is a view showing an edge of a cover window according to an example useful for understanding the invention.Exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described in more detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments of the present invention are shown.

The cover window 10 may be attached to the display panel by a predetermined adhesive layer. As an example, the display panel and the cover window 10 may be separated from each other via an air layer disposed between the display panel and the cover window 10. The display panel may include an organic light emitting panel, or a liquid crystal panel.The shape of the cover window 10 may be changed depending on the shape of the display panel, and a curvature of a bent portion of the cover window 10 may be changed depending on the curvature of the display panel. Referring to FIG. 1, opposite edges of the cover window 10 have the bent shape (are curved), however exemplary embodiments of the present invention are not limited thereto, and the shape of the cover window may be changed, as desired.A shape of the edge of the cover window according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described in more detail below with reference to FIG. 2 and FIG. 3.FIG. 2 is a partially cut-away perspective view of an edge of a cover window according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of an edge of a cover window according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.Referring to FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, the cover window 10 may include a plastic layer 110 and a first hard coating layer 120 disposed on an upper surface of the plastic layer 110.The plastic layer 110 may include a plastic material such as a PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate) series or polycarbonate series plastic.

The second hard coating layer 130 may include an organic material or an organic/inorganic mixture material. The second hard coating layer 130 may have a hardness of more than an HB pencil hardness. The second hard coating layer 130 may include the same material as the first hard coating layer 120, and the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130 may be substantially symmetrical.The first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130 may each protect the plastic layer 110 and may each increase the hardness of the cover window 10.An edge of the cover window 10 may include a vertical side part 310 positioned at a centre of the plastic layer 110 in a thickness direction, and a first inclined part 320 connected to the vertical side part 310. The edge of the cover window 10 may include a first horizontal part 330 connected to the first inclined part 320 and a second inclined part 340 connected to the first horizontal part 330. The edge of the cover window 10 may include a third inclined part 350 connected to the vertical side part 310, a second horizontal part 360 connected to the third inclined part 350, and a fourth inclined part 370 connected to the second horizontal part 360.The vertical side part 310 may have a surface that is substantially perpendicular to the upper surface and the lower surface of the plastic layer 110. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the second hard coating layer 130, the third inclined part 350, the second horizontal part 360, and the fourth inclined part 370 may be omitted, and in this case, the vertical side part 310 may extend from the center of the plastic layer 110 in the thickness direction of the plastic layer 110 toward a lower end of the plastic layer 110. That is, the vertical side part 310 may be connected to the lower surface of the plastic layer 110.The first inclined part 320 may connect the vertical side part 310 and the first horizontal part 330 and may be inclined with respect to the vertical side part 310 at a predetermined angle. The first inclined part 320 may be inclined with respect to the vertical side part 310 at an angle of from about 30 degrees to about 60 degrees. For example, the first inclined part 320 may have an angle of about 45 degrees with respect to the vertical side part 310.The first horizontal part 330 may be substantially parallel with the upper surface and the lower surface of the plastic layer 110. The first horizontal part 330 may connect the first inclined part 320 and the second inclined part 340.The second inclined part 340 may connect the first horizontal part 330 and the upper surface of the first hard coating layer 120. The second inclined part 340 may be inclined with respect to the first horizontal part 330 at a predetermined angle. The second inclined part 340 may be inclined with respect to the first horizontal part 330 at an angle of from about 30 degrees to about 60 degrees. For example, the second inclined part 340 may have an angle of about 38 degrees with respect to the first horizontal part 330.The third inclined part 350 may connect the vertical side part 310 and the second horizontal part 360 and may be inclined with respect to the vertical side part 310 at a predetermined angle. The third inclined part 350 may be substantially symmetrical to the first inclined part 320.The second horizontal part 360 may be substantially parallel with the upper surface and the lower surface of the plastic layer 110. The second horizontal part 360 may connect the third inclined part 350 and the fourth inclined part 370. The second horizontal part 360 may be substantially symmetrical to the first horizontal part 330.The fourth inclined part 370 may connect the second horizontal part 360 and the lower surface of the second hard coating layer 130. The fourth inclined part 370 may be inclined with respect to the second horizontal part 360 at a predetermined angle. The fourth inclined part 370 may be substantially symmetrical to the second inclined part 340.The vertical side part 310, the first inclined part 320, and the third inclined part 350 may include a mechanical processing trace. The vertical side part 310, the first inclined part 320, and the third inclined part 350 may be positioned at the edge of the plastic layer 110. As an example, the mechanical processing may be performed by a method using a computer numerical control (CNC) processing machine.The first horizontal part 330, the second inclined part 340, the second horizontal part 360, and the fourth inclined part 370 may include the laser processing trace. The first horizontal part 330 and the second horizontal part 360 may be positioned at the edge of the plastic layer 110. A first part of the second inclined part 340 and a first part of the fourth inclined part 370 may be positioned at the edge of the plastic layer 110, and a second part of the second inclined part 340 may be positioned at the edge of the first hard coating layer 120, and a second part of the fourth inclined part 370 may be positioned at the edge of the second hard coating layer 130. As an example, a portion of the first hard coating layer 120 adjacent to the first inclined part 320 and the portion of the second hard coating layer 130 adjacent to the third inclined part 350 may include the laser processing trace.The vertical side part 310 may be separated from the second inclined part 340 and may be separated from the fourth inclined part 370. That is, the vertical side part 310 may have a protruding shape with respect to the plastic layer 110. Thus, when an external impact is applied to a side of the cover window (e.g., cover window 10), a possibility that the vertical side part 310 receives the impact is relatively high. The vertical side part 310 may protrude from the plastic layer 110 such that the possibility that the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130 receive the impact is relatively low. Thus, in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, an occurrence of a crack at the edge of the first hard coating layer 120 and/or the second hard coating layer 130 may be reduced or prevented.The first hard coating layer 120 and second hard coating layer 130 may be relatively hard, and thus a mechanical processing trace may remain at edges of the first hard coating layer 120 and/or the second hard coating layer 130. When the mechanical processing trace remains, there may be an increased possibility of the crack being caused at edges of the first hard coating layer 120 and/or the second hard coating layer 130 by the bending of the cover window (e.g., cover window 110). In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the mechanical processing trace does not remain at the edges of the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130, and only the laser processing trace remains. Thus, the edges of the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130 have a substantially even shape, and thus an occurrence of a crack may be reduced or prevented during bending of the cover window (e.g., cover window 10).The cover window according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention may prevent the crack from being generated by the bending and the impact at the edges of the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130.A shape of the edge of the cover window according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described in more detail below with reference to FIG. 4.The cover window according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention described with reference to FIG. 4 is substantially the same as the cover window according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention described with reference to FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, and thus duplicative descriptions may be omitted. According to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention described with reference to FIG. 4, the edge shape of the plastic layer may be different from the edge shape according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention described with reference to FIG. 2 and FIG. 3. Thus, the edge shape of the plastic layer according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described in more detail below with reference to FIG. 4.FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view showing an edge of a cover window according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.Referring to FIG. 4, the cover window 11 according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention may include the plastic layer 110 and the first hard coating layer 120 positioned at the upper surface of the plastic layer 110, and may include the second hard coating layer 130 positioned at the lower surface of the plastic layer 110. The shape of the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130 may be substantially symmetrical.The edge of the cover window 11 may include a vertical side part 310 positioned at the center of the plastic layer 110 in the thickness direction, the first inclined part 320 connected to the vertical side part 310, the first horizontal part 330 connected to the first inclined part 320, and the second inclined part 340 connected to the first horizontal part 330. The edge of the cover window may include the third inclined part 350 connected to the vertical side part 310, the second horizontal part 360 connected to the third inclined part 350, and the fourth inclined part 370 connected to the second horizontal part 360. The first inclined part 320, the first horizontal part 330, and the second inclined part 340 may be substantially symmetrical to the third inclined part 350, the second horizontal part 360, and the fourth inclined part 370, respectively.The first horizontal part 330 and the second horizontal part 360 according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention may include the laser processing trace, however exemplary embodiments of the present invention are not limited thereto. For example, the first horizontal part 330 and the second horizontal part 360 need not include the laser processing trace. The first horizontal part 330 and the second horizontal part 360 may include a step, and thus the first horizontal part 330 may be lower than the upper surface of the plastic layer 110, however exemplary embodiments of the present invention are not limited thereto. For example, the first horizontal part 330 and the second horizontal part 360 have a shape that is substantially parallel with the upper surface of the plastic layer 110.The first part of the second inclined part 340 may be positioned at the edge of the plastic layer 110 and the second part of the second inclined part 340 may be positioned at the edge of the first hard coating layer 120, however exemplary embodiments of the present invention are not limited thereto. For example, the second inclined part 340 may be entirely positioned at the edge of the first hard coating layer 120.The first part of the fourth inclined part 370 may be positioned at the edge of the plastic layer 110 and the second part of the fourth inclined part 370 may be positioned at the edge of the second hard coating layer 130, however exemplary embodiments of the present invention are not limited thereto. For example, the fourth inclined part 370 may be entirely positioned at the edge of the second hard coating layer 130.The vertical side part 310 may be separated from the second inclined part 340 and may be separated from the fourth inclined part 370, and thus the vertical side part 310 may have a protruding shape with respect to the plastic layer 110. The mechanical processing trace might not remain at the edges of the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130, and only the laser processing trace remains according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the cover window according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention may reduce or prevent an occurrence of cracks generated by the bending and the impact in the edges of the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130.The shape of the edge of the cover window according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described in more detail below with reference to FIG. 5. A cover window 12 according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention described with reference to FIG. 5 is substantially the same as the cover window according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention described with reference to FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, and thus duplicative descriptions may be omitted. In the exemplary embodiment of the present invention described with reference to FIG. 5, the position where the laser processing trace remains is partially different from that of the exemplary embodiment of the present invention described with reference to FIG. 2 and FIG. 3. Thus, the position where the laser processing trace remains according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described in more detail below with reference to FIG. 5.FIG. 5 is a cross-sectional view showing an edge of a cover window according to an example useful for understanding of the present invention.Referring to FIG. 5, the cover window 12 may include the plastic layer 110 and the first hard coating layer 120 positioned at the upper surface of the plastic layer 110, and may include the second hard coating layer 130 positioned at the lower surface of the plastic layer 110. The shape of the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130 may be substantially symmetrical.The edge of the cover window 12 may include a vertical side part 410 positioned at the center of the plastic layer 110 in the thickness direction and a first inclined part 420 connected to the vertical side part 410. The edge of the cover window may include a second inclined part 430 connected to the vertical side part 410.The vertical side part 410 may include a surface that is substantially perpendicular to the upper surface and the lower surface of the plastic layer 110. The first inclined part 420 and the second inclined part 430 may be inclined with respect to the vertical side part 410 at a predetermined angle.The vertical side part 410, the first inclined part 420, and the second inclined part 430 may include the mechanical processing trace. The vertical side part 410 may be positioned at the edge of the plastic layer 110. A first part of the first inclined part 420 may be positioned at an edge of the plastic layer 110, and a second part of the first inclined part 420 may be positioned at an edge of the first hard coating layer 120. A first part of the second inclined part 430 may be positioned at an edge of the plastic layer 110 and a second part of the second inclined part 430 positioned at the second hard coating layer 130.The edge of the cover window 12 may include a first groove 510 adjacent to the first inclined part 420 and a second groove 520 adjacent to the second inclined part 430.The first groove 510 may be positioned at the upper surface of the cover window. The first groove 510 may be relatively close and adjacent to the first inclined part 420 without being connected to the first inclined part 420. A first island pattern part 515 may be positioned between the first groove 510 and the first inclined part 420. The first island pattern part 515 may be disposed on the plastic layer 110.The second groove 520 may be positioned at the lower surface of the cover window 12. The second groove 520 may be relatively close and adjacent to the second inclined part 430 without being connected to the second inclined part 430. A second island pattern part 525 may be positioned between the second groove 520 and the second inclined part 430. The second island pattern part 525 may be disposed on the plastic layer 110.The first groove 510 and the second groove 520 may include the laser processing trace.The first groove 510 may be formed through the first hard coating layer 120 and through the edge of the plastic layer 110. However, examples useful for understanding of the present invention are not limited thereto. For example, the first groove 510 may be formed in the first hard coating layer 120, but need not be formed in the plastic layer 110. The depth of the first groove 510 may be larger than or equal to the thickness of the first hard coating layer 120. When the depth of the first groove 510 is larger than the thickness of the first hard coating layer 120, the first groove 510 may be formed in the first hard coating layer 120 and the plastic layer 110. When the depth of the first groove 510 is the same as the thickness of the first hard coating layer 120, the first groove 510 may be formed in the first hard coating layer 120.The second groove 520 may be formed through the second hard coating layer 130 and through the edge of the plastic layer 110. However, examples useful for understanding of the present invention are not limited thereto. For example, the second groove 520 may be formed in the second hard coating layer 130, but need not be formed in the plastic layer 110. The depth of the second groove 520 may be larger than or equal to the thickness of the second hard coating layer 130. When the depth of the second groove 520 is larger than the thickness of the second hard coating layer 130, the second groove 520 may be formed in the second hard coating layer 130 and the plastic layer 110. When the depth of the second groove 520 is the same as the thickness of the second hard coating layer 130, the second groove 520 may be formed in the second hard coating layer 130.The vertical side part 410 may be separated from the first groove 510 and the second groove 520. Thus, when an external impact is applied to the side of the cover window (e.g., side window 12), the possibility of the vertical side part 410 receiving the impact may be increased. The vertical side part 410 may protrude from the plastic layer 110 such that the possibility of the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130 receive the impact is relatively low. Even if the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130 receive the impact, the first island pattern part 515 or the second island pattern part 525 may absorb the impact and reduce or eliminate an occurrence of a crack. Since the first island pattern part 515 is separated from the rest of the first hard coating layer 120 by the first groove 510, even if the crack is generated by the impact in the first island pattern part 515, the growth of the crack may be reduced or prevented. Since the second island pattern part 525 is separated from the rest of the second hard coating layer 130 by the second groove 520, even if the impact is generated in the second island pattern part 525, the growth of the crack may be reduced or prevented.The first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130 may be relatively hard, thus a mechanical processing trace may remain at edges of the first hard coating layer 120 and/or the second hard coating layer 130, and thus the edges may be relatively uneven such that there is a possibility of the crack being caused by the bending. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the first inclined part 420 may be positioned at the first hard coating layer 120, the second inclined part 430 may be positioned at the second hard coating layer 130, and the first inclined part 420 and the second inclined part 430 may include the mechanical processing trace. Thus, an occurrence of a crack may be reduced or prevented in the edges of the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130. For example, the crack may be generated in the first island pattern part 515 of the first hard coating layer 120 and/or the second island pattern part 525 of the second hard coating layer 130. The first island pattern part 515 is separated from the rest of the first hard coating layer 120 by the first groove 510 such that the growth of the crack may be prevented even if the crack is generated by the bending in the first island pattern part 515. The second island pattern part 525 is separated from the rest of the second hard coating layer 130 by the second groove 520 such that the growth of the crack may be prevented even if the crack is generated by the bending in the second island pattern part 525.The cover window may reduce or prevent the growth of the crack even if the crack is generated by the bending and the impact in the edges of the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130.A manufacturing method of a cover window according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described in more detail below with reference to FIG. 6 to FIG. 11.FIG. 6 is a flowchart showing a manufacturing method of a cover window according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.

The plastic material may include, for example. a PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate) series or polycarbonate series plastic. The plastic material in the liquid state may be injected into a mold 710. For example, the plastic in the liquid state may be injected into the mold 710 through an inlet by a piston. The mold 710 may include two parts that may be separated from each other. The plastic material may be solidified in the mold when the two parts of the mold are together, and after solidifying the plastic material the two parts may be separated and the solidified plastic may be removed. Thus, a base shape of a cover window (e.g., the cover window 10) may be formed.Hard coating the cover window S1020 will be described in more detail below with reference to FIG. 8.Referring to FIG. 8, the cover window may be immersed in a water tank 720 and a hard coating layer may be formed. The hard coating layer may include a first hard coating layer (e.g., the first hard coating layer 120) and a second hard coating layer (e.g., the second hard coating layer 130). The first hard coating layer and the second hard coating layer may be formed at the upper surface and the lower surface of the plastic layer, respectively. A material included in the hard coating layer may include an organic material such as an ultraviolet ray hardening acrylate series material and/or an ultraviolet ray hardening epoxy series material. A material included in the hard coating layer may include an organic/inorganic mixture material further including an inorganic material such as a nano-silica sol material. The hard coating layer may have a hardness that is more than an HB pencil hardness.Processing a shape of the cover window S1030 will be described in more detail below with reference to FIG. 9.Referring to FIG. 9, the shape of the hard-coated cover window may be processed. The cover window may be mechanically processed by using a computer numerical control (CNC) processing machine 730. The processing may be performed while a blade 740 is rotated at high speed and an edge of the cover window is cut. A process of irradiating an edge of the cover window using a laser may be performed following the mechanical processing.Attaching a decorative film to the cover window S1040 will be described in more detail below with reference to FIG. 10.Referring to FIG. 10, a decorative film 750 may be attached to a lower surface of the cover window. While the decorative film 750 is positioned under the cover window and a roller 760 is rotated, the decorative film 750 may be attached to the cover window. The decorative film 750 may include, for example, a company logo.Performing fingerprint resistant printing on a surface of the cover window S1050 will be described in more detail below with reference to FIG. 11.Referring to FIG. 11, fingerprint resistant printing S1050 may be performed on a surface of the cover window by using an electron beam depositor 770. Thus, even if the surface of the cover window is touched, a presence of fingerprints may be reduced or eliminated.The shape processing process of the cover window described with reference to FIG. 9 will be described in more detail below with reference to FIG. 12 to FIG. 14.FIG. 12 to FIG. 14 are cross-sectional views showing a shape processing process of a cover window according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.Referring to FIG. 12, mechanical processing may be performed to the edge of a cover window (e.g., the cover window 10). The cover window may include the plastic layer 110 and the first hard coating layer 120 positioned at the upper surface of the plastic layer 110. The cover window may include the second hard coating layer 130 positioned at the lower surface of the plastic layer 110. The mechanical processing may be performed to the edges of the plastic layer 110, the first hard coating layer 120, and the second hard coating layer 130. While the blade 740 is rotated based on a vertical axis, the edges of the plastic layer 110, the first hard coating layer 120, and the second hard coating layer 130 may be cut.The shape of the cover window may be changed depending on the shape of the blade 740. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the blade 740 may have a shape in which a radius of a center part is substantially constant, and the radius increases from the center part to a lower side and an upper side. The cut edge of the cover window may include the vertical side part 310, the first inclined part 320, and the third inclined part 350 formed by the mechanical processing.The vertical side part 310 may be a surface of the cover window that is substantially perpendicular to the upper surface and the lower surface of the plastic layer 110. The vertical side part 310 may be positioned at an edge of the plastic layer 110.The first inclined part 320 may be inclined with respect to the vertical side part 310 at a predetermined angle. A first part of the first inclined part 320 may be positioned at an edge of the plastic layer 110 and a second part of the first inclined part 320 may be positioned at an edge of the first hard coating layer 120.The third inclined part 350 may be inclined with respect to the vertical side part 310 at a predetermined angle. A first part of the third inclined part 350 may be positioned at an edge of the plastic layer 110 and a second part of the third inclined part 350 may be positioned at an edge of the second hard coating layer 130.Referring to FIG. 13, laser processing may be performed to the mechanically processed edge of the cover window. For example, the laser processing may be performed to the edge of the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130 of the cover window.A laser 780 may be radiated along the first inclined part 320 and along the third inclined part 350. For example, the laser 780 may be radiated along the first part of the first inclined part 320 positioned at the edge of the plastic layer 110 and along the second part of the first inclined part 320 positioned at the edge of the first hard coating layer 120; and the laser 780 may be radiated along the first part of the third inclined part 350 positioned at the edge of the plastic layer 110 and along the second part of the third inclined part 350 positioned at the edge of the second hard coating layer 130. However, exemplary embodiments of the present invention are not limited thereto. The laser 780 may be radiated more inside than the position where the first inclined part 320 of the first hard coating layer 120 starts, and the laser 780 may be radiated more inside than the position where the third inclined part 350 of the second hard coating layer 130 starts.The laser 780 may be substantially simultaneously radiated to the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130, or the laser may be radiated to the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130 at different times. After the laser is first radiated to the first hard coating layer 120, the cover window may be turned over and the laser may be radiated to the second hard coating layer 130.The laser processing may employ a carbon dioxide gas laser.Referring to FIG. 14, the first horizontal part 330, the second inclined part 340, the second horizontal part 360, and the fourth inclined part 370 may be formed at the edge of the cover window by the laser 780.A laser processing trace may remain at the first horizontal part 330, the second inclined part 340, the second horizontal part 360, and the fourth inclined part 370. For example, bubbles or craters may be found. A mechanical processing trace may remain at the vertical side part 310, the first inclined part 320, and the third inclined part 350. Before performing the laser processing, the mechanical processing trace may be at the edges of the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130. The mechanical processing trace formed at the edges of the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130 may be removed by the laser processing process according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.In the laser processing process, intensity and time of the laser radiation may be controlled. For example, until the plastic layer 110 is at least exposed, the laser may be radiated to the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130. After the plastic layer 110 is exposed, if the laser is radiated to the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130, the second inclined part 340 and the fourth inclined part 370 may be formed at the plastic layer 110. If the laser is radiated to the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130, the plastic layer 110 might be exposed and the second inclined part 340 and the fourth inclined part 370 may be omitted (see, e.g., FIG. 4).The radiation intensity may be controlled by changing a power of the laser. The power of the laser may be set to be different depending on the thickness of the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130. For example, when the thickness of the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130 is from 0 µm to about 5 µm (up to 5 µm), the power of the laser may be from about 2.5 W to about 3.5 W. When the thickness of the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130 is from about 5 µm to about 10 µm, the power of the laser may be from about 3.0 W to about 4.0 W. When the thickness of the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130 is from about 10 µm to about 15 µm, the power of the laser may be from about 3.5 W to about 4.5 W.When the thickness of the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130 is from about 15 µm to about 20 µm, the power of the laser may be from about 4.0 W to about 5.0 W. When the thickness of the first hard coating layer 120 and the second hard coating layer 130 is from about 20 µm to about 25 µm, the power of the laser may be from about 4.5 W to about 5.5 W. The power of the laser may refer to power that is actually output from the laser.The shape of the edge of the cover window may be changed depending on the radiation position of the laser in the laser processing process. For example, the laser may be radiated to form the first groove 510 in the first hard coating layer 120 and/or the second groove 520 in the second hard coating layer 130.A depth of the first groove 510 and a depth of the second groove 520 may be controlled by controlling the radiation intensity of the laser. The depth of the first groove 510 may be larger than or equal to the thickness of the first hard coating layer 120. The depth of the second groove 520 may be larger than or equal to the thickness of the second hard coating layer 130.A shape of an edge of the cover window resulting from a manufacturing process according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described in more detail below with reference to FIG. 15 to FIG. 17.FIG. 15 is a view showing an edge of a cover window according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention after mechanical processing. FIG. 16 and FIG. 17 are views showing an edge of a cover window according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention after laser processing. FIG. 15 to FIG. 17 show 3D images of a cover window that is manufactured according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.Referring to FIG. 15, a shape of an edge part P1 of a cover window after performing mechanical processing may have a relatively uneven shape. If the cover window is bent in this state, a crack may be generated at the edge part P1 of a first hard coating layer. The generated crack may gradually grow such that the other portion of the first hard coating layer may be affected.Referring to FIG. 16, a shape of an edge part P2 after performing the laser processing may have a relatively even shape compared with the edge part Pi. In this state, even if the cover window is bent, a crack might not be generated in the edge part P2 of the first hard coating layer.Referring to FIG. 17, a first groove may be formed at a third part P3 by laser processing. The part P3 where the first groove is formed may have a relatively even shape. In this state, if the cover window is bent, even if a crack is generated at the first hard coating layer, the crack might not spread past the third part P3. Thus, the crack might now spread in the first hard coating layer beyond the first groove formed at the third part P3.While the present invention has been shown and described with reference to the exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made thereto without departing from the scope of the present invention as defined by the claims.]   \n",

More particularly, the disclosure relates to implantable screws configured to provide compression upon a bone into which the screw is implanted.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONA broken bone must be carefully stabilized and supported until it is strong enough to handle the body's weight and movement. Until the last century, physicians relied on casts and splints to support and stabilize the bone from outside the body. The advent of sterile surgical procedures reduced the risk of infection, allowing doctors to internally set and stabilize fractured bones. During a surgical procedure to set a fracture, the bone fragments are first repositioned (reduced) into their normal alignment. They are held together with special implants, such as plates, screws, nails and wires.Screws are used for internal fixation more often than any other type of implant. Although the screw is a simple device, there are different designs based on the type of fracture and how the screw will be used. Screws come in different sizes for use with bones of different sizes. Screws can be used alone to hold a fracture, as well as with plates, rods, or nails. After the bone heals, screws may be either left in place or removed.In many instances, it is desired that the inserted screw provide compression at the bone joint or fracture line to reduce the incidence of nonunion (improper healing) and malunion (healing in improper position) of broken bones.WO2004/069031 describes a screw assembly according to the known art.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONTo meet this and other needs, devices, systems for fixating bone are provided. In particular, bone screws are provided that apply compression to bone fragments or bone portions (for example, fixation of fractures or fusion of joints), are self-tapping and/or self-drilling, minimize or prevent screw toggle and/or back-out, remove bone build-up (for example, from cutting flutes), and the like.The invention is defined by the independent claim 1. Further advantageous aspects of the invention are set forth in the dependent claimsIn at least one embodiment, a compression screw is provided for applying compression at a bone joint. The compression screw includes an axial screw body extending from a distal end to a proximal end with the distal end including a series of bone engaging threads configured to be self-drilling and self-tapping and the proximal end including a head which defines a radially extending shoulder. At least one proximal rotary cutting structure is defined proximally of the bone engaging threads. The at least one proximal rotary cutting structure is configured to be self-drilling such that a proximal portion of the axial screw body cuts into and advances within a bone of the bone joint as the axial screw body is advanced.In at least one embodiment, the compression screw for applying compression at a bone joint includes a bone screw and a compression sleeve. The bone screw extends from a distal end to a proximal end with the bone screw distal end including a series of bone engaging threads configured to be self-drilling and self-tapping and the bone screw proximal end including a series of external threads. The compression sleeve has a tubular body extending from a distal end to a proximal end with the compression sleeve distal end defining a proximal rotary cutting structure and the compression sleeve proximal end including a head which defines a radially extending shoulder. The compression sleeve includes internal threads engaged with the bone screw external threads such that the compression sleeve and bone screw are threadably adjustable relative to one another. The proximal rotary cutting structure is configured to be self-drilling such that a portion of the compression sleeve cuts into and advances within a bone of the bone joint as the compression screw is advanced.It is described but it does not form part of the invention a method of inserting a compression screw into a bone joint includes engaging the compression screw with a driver assembly, the driver assembly including a first driver and a second driver, the first and second drivers co-axial with one another and selectively rotatable together or independently of one another; rotating the first and second drivers simultaneously to advance the compression screw into the bone joint until the compression screw is at a first desired location; and rotating the first driver while maintaining the second driver stationary whereby at least a portion of the compression screw is further advanced into the bone joint such that a compressive force is applied to the bone joint.According to a further aspect of the invention, it is provided a compression screw for applying compression at a bone joint, the compression screw comprising: a bone screw extending from a distal end to a proximal end, the bone screw distal end including a series of bone engaging threads configured to be self-drilling and self-tapping, and the bone screw proximal end including a series of external threads; a compression sleeve having a tubular body extending from a distal end to a proximal end, the compression sleeve distal end defining a proximal rotary cutting structure and the compression sleeve proximal end including a head which defines a radially extending shoulder, the compression sleeve including internal threads engaged with the bone screw external threads such that the compression sleeve and bone screw are threadably adjustable relative to one another; wherein the proximal rotary cutting structure is configured to be self-drilling such that a portion of the compression sleeve cuts into and advances within a bone of the bone joint as the compression screw is advanced.In a version, the bone screw proximal end and the compression sleeve proximal end each define a distinct driver feature.In a further version, the head includes external threads such that the head is self-countersinking, the external threads on the head defining a second proximal rotary cutting structure.In another version, the at least one proximal rotary cutting structures is defined by a plurality of cutting flutes defined at the compression sleeve distal end.Advantageously, each cutting flute has a slot extending therefrom, each slot recessed into the tubular body.Advantageously, the cutting flutes have a trajectory and each slot has a trajectory substantially equal to the trajectory of the cutting flutes.In a version, the cutting flutes have a trajectory and each slot has a trajectory greater than the trajectory of the cutting flutes.In a further version each slot has a trajectory substantially parallel to an axis of the compression sleeve.

Certain terminology is used herein for convenience only and is not to be taken as a limitation on the present invention. The following describes preferred examples and embodiments of the present invention. However, it should be understood, based on this disclosure, that the invention is not limited by the preferred embodiments described herein.Devices, systems for fixating bone are provided. In particular, bone screws are provided that may apply compression to bone fragments or bone portions. This may be particularly effective, for example, in trauma applications for fixation of bone fractures and/or fusion of joints. The disclosed devices may be used for repairing bones including, but not limited to, the femur, tibia, fibula, humerus, ulna, radius, metatarsals, phalanx, phalanges, ribs, spine, vertebrae, clavicle, and other bones. Any of the features described herein may be applied to standalone screws or screws that additionally include a compression sleeve.Referring to Figs. 1-2 and 8, a compression screw 10 in accordance with an embodiment will be described. The compression screw 10 generally comprises a bone screw 12 and a compression sleeve 30. The bone screw 12 and the compression sleeve 30 may be constructed from any biocompatible material including, but not limited to, stainless steel alloys, titanium, titanium based alloys, or polymeric materials.The bone screw 12 includes a shaft 14 extending from a distal end 11 to a proximal end 13. Referring to Figs. 2 and 8, in the illustrated embodiment, a cannula 20 extends from the distal end 11 to the proximal end 13 such that a guide wire may be used for positioning the compression screw 10. A drive feature 22 is defined in the proximal end 13 of the shaft 14 and is configured and dimensioned to be any shape that corresponds with the end of the driving instrument designed to engage the bone screw 12. As an example, in the illustrated embodiment, the drive feature 22 has a hexalobular configuration.A series of bone engaging threads 15 extend radially from the shaft 14 at the distal end 11 and a series of sleeve engaging threads 18 extend radially from the shaft 14 at the proximal end 13. In the preferred embodiment, the bone engaging threads 15 are dual lead thread type and the sleeve engaging threads 18 are a standard machine thread. However, any type of thread for either thread series 15, 18 may be used to facilitate the function of the compression screw 10. The bone screw 12 preferably also includes at least one cutting flute 16 configured to cut into the bone as the bone screw 12 is rotated, defining a self-drilling and self-tapping tip. In a preferred embodiment, a slot 17 is associated with each cutting flute 16 to clear any chips, dust, or debris generated when the compression screw 10 is implanted into bone tissue.The compression sleeve 30 includes a tubular body 32 extending from a distal end 31 to a proximal end 31 with an internal passage 40 therethrough. The compression sleeve 30 includes a series of internal threads 39 (see Fig. 8) configured to engage the sleeve engaging threads 18 of the bone screw 12 such that the bone screw 12 and the compression sleeve 30 are threadably adjustable to one another. The proximal end 33 of the compression sleeve 30 defines a radially extending head 34 which defines a shoulder 35 between the tubular body 32 and the head 34. A drive feature 42 is defined in the head 34 of the compression sleeve 30 and is configured and dimensioned to be any shape that corresponds with the end of the driving instrument designed to engage the compression sleeve 30. As an example, in the illustrated embodiment, the drive feature 42 has a hexalobular configuration.As will be described in more detail hereinafter, during insertion of the implant, both drive features 22, 42 are engaged such that the compression screw 10 maintains its full length. After the tip of the bone screw 12 is at the desired depth, only the drive feature 42 in the compression sleeve 30 is actuated. Since the two components are connected via threads, actuation of only the compression sleeve 30 will act to move the compression sleeve 30 distally toward the tip of the bone screw 12, which shortens the length of the compression screw 10 and compresses the bone when the shoulder 35 of the compression sleeve 30 is on the near cortex.To facilitate such shortening of the compression screw 10, the distal end 31 of the compression sleeve 30 is provided with one or more cutting flutes 36 configured to cut into the bone as the compression sleeve 30 is rotated. The cutting flutes 36 simplify the procedure by removing material without the necessity of drilling to the outer diameter of the compression sleeve tubular body 32. This also allows the compression screw 10 to be adjusted to any length without the need to predrill to a desired depth to accommodate the compression sleeve 30. In the present embodiment, the cutting flutes 36 define a proximal rotary cutting structure.In the alternative embodiment of the compression sleeve 30' illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4, a slot 38 is associated with each cutting flute 36, with each slot recessed into the surface of the tubular body 32 and configured to guide the aforementioned cut bone into the slots 38. The mechanism of action for this technology relies on first the cutting flutes 36 to remove material from the substrate that it is being inserted into. This material then follows through the path of the slots 38 by one of two mechanisms: (1) path of least resistance (the material has nowhere else to go) or (2) the trajectory of the slots 38 roughly follows the pitch of the cutting flutes 36 as it is advanced into the bone, and thus the cutaway material stays close to its original position as the screw advances axially via the screw's helix.The slots 38 serve two functions: (1) the cut bone that follows the slots 38 acts to enhance the fit between the native bone and the component being inserted into the bone and (2) allows for bony ingrowth to prevent dislodging of the compression screw 10. The cutting flutes 36 act to remove bone and guide said removed bone into the slots 38. This is in effect a self-grafting feature of the compression sleeve 30 which enhances purchase. Surgeons will sometimes remove bone and pack it back into the implant to enhance purchase, however, this configuration on the compression sleeve 30 does that for them. Enhanced purchase acts to prevent screw toggle and screw axial motion. Even if the slots 38 are not filled with bone, they can act to prevent both screw toggle and screw axial motion by providing a surface to catch on the native bone. Additionally, the slots 38 provide a surface for bony ingrowth which can also prevent screw toggle and screw axial motion.While the trajectory of the slots 38 is shown in the embodiment of Figs. 3 and 4 to roughly follow the pitch of the cutting flutes 36, the slots may have other configurations. For example, in the compression sleeve 30\" illustrated in Fig. 5, the slot 38' has a steeper trajectory than the pitch of the cutting flutes. Fig. 6 illustrates another embodiment of the compression sleeve 30''' wherein the slot 38\" has an even steeper trajectory, being substantially parallel to the axis of the compression sleeve 30'''. In addition to having different trajectories, the slots 38, 38', 38\" may have different pitches resulting in the slots being spaced closer together or further apart. Additionally, the slots 38, 38', 38\" may have different configurations, for example, semi-circular, semi-oval, v-shaped, square, rectangular or the like. Furthermore, while the combination of cutting flutes 36 and slots 38, 38', 38\" are illustrated in conjunction with the compression sleeve 30, it is recognized that such can be applied to a surface of any type of component that is being inserted into bone.Having generally described the compression screw 10, an exemplary driver assembly 100 for inserting the compression screw 10 and an exemplary method of insertion will be described with reference to Figs. 7 and 8.The driver assembly 100 has a bone screw driver 110 and a compression sleeve driver 120. The bone screw driver 110 includes a driver shaft 112 extending from a distal end 111 to a proximal end 113. A driver tip 114 is defined on the distal end 111 of the driver shaft 112 and is configured to engage the driver feature 22 of the bone screw 12. A connection key 115 is defined on the proximal end 113 of the driver shaft 112 and is configured to facilitate connection of the bone screw driver 110 to a manual or powered rotation device or a locking device which prevents rotation (not shown). A series of axial splines 116 extend radially from the driver shaft 112 and are configured to be selectively engaged by a connector switch 128 of the compression sleeve driver 120, as will be described in more detail hereinafter. A series of external threads 119 extend from the driver shaft 112 distally of the splines 116. The external threads 119 are configured to be selectively engaged by a thread engagement member 132 of the compression sleeve driver 120, as will be described in more detail hereinafter.The compression sleeve driver 120 extends from a distal end 121 to a proximal end 123. The proximal end 121 is defined by a tubular body 125 with a driver tip 124 at the distal most end and an outward housing 130 proximally therefrom. The driver tip 124 is configured to engage the driver feature 42 of the compression sleeve 30. The housing 130 defines a radial chamber in which the thread engagement member 132 is radially moveable. Upon depression of the thread engagement member 132, internal threads thereof engage the external threads 119 of the driver shaft 112 such that the driver shaft 112 is caused to move axially with the compression sleeve driver 120 when they are rotated together as will be described.A handle member 126 extends proximally from the housing 130 to the proximal end 123. The connector switch 128 extends transversely through the handle member 126 and is moveable between a non-engaged position (see Fig. 8) and an engaged position (see Fig. 13). In the non-engaged position, an open area 129 of the connector switch 128 aligns with the splines 116 such that the switch 128 is not engaged with the splines 116 and the compression sleeve driver 120 rotates independent of the bone screw driver 110. In the engaged position, a contact portion 127 of the connector switch 128 engages the splines 116 such that rotation of the compression sleeve driver 120 causes simultaneous rotation of the bone screw driver 110.To insert the compression screw 10, the driver assembly 100 is positioned such that the driver tip 114 of the shaft 112 engages with the drive feature 22 of the bone screw 12 and the driver tip 124 of the tubular body 125 engages with the drive feature 42 of the compression sleeve 30, as shown in Fig. 8. During initial insertion, the connector switch 128 is moved to the engaged position such that the bone screw driver 110 and the compression sleeve driver 120 rotate together. The driver assembly 100 is rotated with both drivers 110, 120 rotating and thus the compression screw 10 is advanced as a single unit until the distal end 11 of the bone screw 12 is at a desired location. The thread engagement member 132 may be depressed during such rotation to ensure that the shaft 112 advances axially during the simultaneous rotation. If the distal end 31 of the compression sleeve 30 contacts bone as the compression screw 10 is advanced, the proximal rotary cutting structure, i.e. the cutting flutes 36, cut into the bone and the compression screw 10 is free to continue to advance as a single unit.After the distal end 11 of the bone screw 12 has landed at the desired location, compression may be achieved by advancing the compression sleeve 30 while the bone screw 12 remains stationary. The bone screw 12 remains stationary by holding the bone screw driver 110 stationary, for example, by attaching a locking device to the connection key 115, and by disengaging the connector switch 128. With the connector switch 128 moved to the disengaged position, the compression sleeve driver 120 rotates freely about the bone screw driver 110. Rotation of the compression sleeve driver 120 causes the compression sleeve 30 to advance. Since the bone screw 12 is stationary as the compression sleeve driver 120 advances the compression sleeve 30, the compression screw 10 shortens in length and the shoulder 35 thus applies compression. Again, the cutting flutes 36 on the compression sleeve distal end 31 allow the compression sleeve 30 to cut into and advance into the bone.Referring to Figs. 9-10, a compression screw 10' in accordance with another exemplary embodiment will be described. The compression screw 10' is substantially the same as the previous embodiment except with the addition of a self-countersinking head 34' on the compression sleeve 30iv. The self-countersinking head 34' has a tapered shoulder 35' and a series of external threads 37. The threads 37 are configured to be self-drilling and self-tapping. The self-countersinking head 34' is advantageous in that the head does not protrude from the near cortex, which minimizes soft-tissue irritation and can reduce the reoperation rate. In the present embodiment, the cutting flutes 36 and the threads 37 each define a proximal rotary cutting structure. In all other aspects, the compression screw 10' is the same as the previously described compression screw 10.Referring to Figs. 11-13, a driver assembly 100' and method for inserting the compression screw 10' will be described. The driver assembly 100' is substantially the same as in the previous embodiment except for the distal end 121' of tubular body 125' of the compression sleeve driver 120'. Instead of a driver tip, the distal end 121' defines an internally threaded chamber 122 which threadably engages the threads 137 of the self-countersinking head 34'.To insert the compression screw 10', the driver assembly 100' is positioned such that the driver tip 114 of the shaft 112 engages with the drive feature 22 of the bone screw 12 and the threads 137 of the self-countersinking head 34' are threadably received in the threaded chamber 122 of the compression sleeve driver 120', as shown in Fig. 13. During initial insertion, the connector switch 128 is moved to the engaged position such that the bone screw driver 110 and the compression sleeve driver 120' rotate together. The driver assembly 100' is rotated with both drivers 110, 120' rotating and thus the compression screw 10' is advanced as a single unit until the distal end 11 of the bone screw 12 is at a desired location. The thread engagement member 132 may be depressed during such rotation to ensure that the shaft 112 advances axially during the simultaneous rotation. If the distal end 31 of the compression sleeve 30iv contacts bone as the compression screw 10' is advanced, the cutting flutes 36 cut into the bone and the compression screw 10' is free to continue to advance as a single unit.After the distal end 11 of the bone screw 12 has landed at the desired location, compression may be achieved by advancing the compression sleeve 30iv while the bone screw 12 remains stationary. The bone screw 12 remains stationary by holding the bone screw driver 110 stationary, for example, by attaching a locking device to the connection key 115, and by disengaging the connector switch 128. With the connector switch 128 moved to the disengaged position, the compression sleeve driver 120' rotates freely about the bone screw driver 110. Rotation of the compression sleeve driver 120' causes the compression sleeve 30iv to advance. Since the bone screw 12 is stationary as the compression sleeve driver 120' advances the compression sleeve 30iv, the compression screw 10' shortens in length and the shoulder 35' and distal end 121' of the compression sleeve driver 120' thus apply compression. Again, the cutting flutes 36 on the compression sleeve distal end 31 allow the compression sleeve 30 to cut into and advance into the bone.After the desired amount of compression has been reached, the head 34' may be countersunk. Countersinking is done by a third driver component (not shown) that mates with the compression sleeve driver feature 42. For example, the driver assembly 100 may be exchanged for the driver assembly 100' such that the driver tip 124 can be used to rotate the compression sleeve 30iv while the bone screw 12 is maintained stationary. As the compression sleeve 30iv advances over the bone screw 12, the threads 37 cut into the bone and advance the head 34' into a countersunk position within the bone.Referring to Figs. 14-16, a compression screw 50 in accordance with another embodiment will be described. The compression screw 50 includes a shaft 52 extending from a distal end 51 to a proximal end 53. A series of bone engaging threads 55 extend radially from the shaft 52 at the distal end 51. In the preferred embodiment, the bone engaging threads 55 are dual lead thread type, however, any type of thread may be used to facilitate the function of the compression screw 50. The distal end 51 preferably also includes at least one cutting flute 56 configured to cut into the bone as the compression screw 12 is rotated, defining a self-drilling and self-tapping tip. In a preferred embodiment, a slot 57 is associated with each cutting flute 56 to clear any chips, dust, or debris generated when the compression screw 50 is implanted into bone tissue.The proximal end 53 of the shaft 52 includes a self-countersinking head 54. The self-countersinking head 54 has a tapered shoulder 68 and a series of external threads 64. The threads 64 may include one or more cutting flutes 66 such that the threads 64 are self-drilling and self-tapping. In the present embodiment, the threads 64 define a proximal rotary cutting structure. A drive feature 62 is defined in the proximal end 53 of the shaft 52 and is configured and dimensioned to be any shape that corresponds with the end of the driving instrument designed to engage the compression screw 50. As an example, in the illustrated embodiment, the drive feature 62 has a hexalobular configuration.The shaft 52 between the bone engaging threads 55 and the head 54 is preferably free of threads. With this configuration, a difference in pitch between the bone engaging threads 55 and the threads 64 of the head 54 can provide additional compression control as the compression screw 50 is inserted. That is, if the pitch of the bone engaging threads 55 is larger than the pitch of the threads 64 of the head 54, and the fracture or joint line lies somewhere in the shaft 52 section of the screw 50, this configuration will provide compression between the two bones as the distal end 51 tries to advance faster than the head 54 of the screw 50.Referring to Figs. 17 and 18, a driver assembly 150 which allows the surgeon to further control how much compression is achieved will be described. The driver assembly 150 includes an inner driver member 152 and an outer driver member 160. The inner driver member 152 extends from a distal end 151 to a proximal end 153. A driver tip 154 is defined on the distal end 151 and is configured to engage the driver feature 62 of the compression screw 50.The outer driver member 160 includes a tubular body extending from a distal end 161 to a proximal end 163. The distal end 161 defines a threaded chamber 164 configured to threadeably receive the threads 64 of the compression screw head 54.To insert the compression screw 50, the driver assembly 50 is positioned with the driver tip 154 engaged with the driver feature 62 and the threads 64 of the head 54 threadably received in the threaded chamber 164. The inner and outer driver members 152, 160 are rotated such that the compression screw 50 is advanced. As the compression screw 50 advances, the distal end 161 of the outer driver member 160 will hit the near cortex and compress the fracture line as the screw 50 is continued to be inserted.After the desired amount of compression has been reached, the inner driver member 152 is rotated, independent of the outer driver member 160, such that the compression screw 50 continues to advance with the outer driver member distal end 161 maintaining the compression. As the compression screw 50 advances, the threads 64 of the head 54 will enter the bone and begin to countersink the head 54. As the head 54 advances and countersinks, it simultaneously threads out of the threaded chamber 164. As explained before, the pitch of the bone engaging threads 55 and the threads 64 of the head 54 may be configured such that countersinking of the head 54 causes additional compression.These and other advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing specification. Accordingly, it will be recognized by those skilled in the art that changes or modifications may be made to the above-described embodiments without departing from the broad inventive concepts of the invention. It should therefore be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular embodiments described herein, but is intended to include all changes and modifications that are within the scope of the invention as defined in the claims.]   \n",



                                                                                                                      [FIELDThe present invention relates to a technical field of electric appliances, and more particularly to a clothes dryer.BACKGROUNDA clothes dryer in the related art is generally provided with a tube-fin evaporator or a multi-channel evaporator.With regard to the clothes dryer having the multi-channel evaporator, fins of the multi-channel evaporator have a high density, so that the multi-channel evaporator has high heat exchange efficiency. However in use of the clothes dryer, matters on the clothes such as dust and fluff flow along with air and accumulate on the multi-channel evaporator, making it difficult to clean the multi-channel evaporator. Coupled with that water condenses on a surface of the multi-channel evaporator and water, dust and fluff tend to be solidified on the surface of the multi-channel evaporator, a resistance of heat transfer between the fin and air is increased, and a heat transfer coefficient of the multi-channel evaporator is reduced, moreover a wind resistance of an air duct of the clothes dryer is increased and a circulating air rate is reduced, which are adverse to an improvement of working efficiency of the clothes dryer.An application US 2009/0223077 A1 relates to a domestic appliance for the care of washed articles which includes a container for receiving the washed articles. The container is arranged in a process air supply of the domestic appliance, whereby process air which flows through the process air supply also flows through the container. And an application EP 2 930 453 A1 provides a heat exchanger assembly and use thereof, the heat exchanger assembly includes a micro-channel evaporator and a micro-channel condenser.SUMMARYEmbodiments of the present invention seek to solve at least one of the problems existing in the related art to at least some extent. To this end, a clothes dryer is provided, which may not only facilitate cleaning of an evaporator, but also may improve heat exchange efficiency, being beneficial for improving working efficiency of the clothes dryer.The clothes dryer according to embodiments of the present invention includes: a casing; a drying drum provided with a drying cavity therein and provided with an air outlet and a return air inlet which are in communication with the drying cavity, in which the drying drum is disposed in the casing and an air duct is defined between the air outlet and the return air inlet of the drying drum and within the casing, in which two ends of the air duct are in communication with the return air inlet and the air outlet respectively; a heat pump system disposed in the casing, including a compressor, a condenser, a throttling element, a multi-channel evaporator and a tube-fin evaporator which form a circulation loop of refrigerant, in which the condenser, the multi-channel evaporator and the tube-fin evaporator are disposed in the air duct, in which in a flowing direction of the air in the air duct, the tube-fin evaporator is located upstream of the multi-channel evaporator. And the clothes dryer is characterized in that the multi-channel evaporator and the tube-fin evaporator are in parallel connection.In the clothes dryer according to embodiments of the present invention, the heat pump system includes the multi-channel evaporator and the tube-fin evaporator at the same time, and the multi-channel evaporator and the tube-fin evaporator are in parallel connection, the condenser, the multi-channel evaporator and the tube-fin evaporator are disposed in the air duct, moreover in the flowing direction of the air in the air duct, the tube-fin evaporator is located upstream of the multi-channel evaporator. Thus, by disposing the multi-channel evaporator and the tube-fin evaporator at the same time, the heat exchange efficiency of the evaporator may be improved, thus improving the working efficiency of the clothes dryer. Moreover in the flowing direction of the air in the air duct, the tube-fin evaporator is located upstream of the multi-channel evaporator, thus the wet air discharged out from the air outlet may firstly run through the tube-fin evaporator and exchange heat with the tube-fin evaporator, and may subsequently continue to flow through the multi-channel evaporator. By this way, the fluff in the air discharged out from the air outlet accumulates on the tube-fin evaporator not on the multi-channel evaporator, not only the fluff on the tube-fin evaporator is easy to clean, but also the multi-channel evaporator is easy to clean, and at the same time the problems, such as an increase of resistance of heat transfer between the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the air, a decrease of heat transfer coefficient of the multi-channel evaporator 34, an increase of wind resistance in the air duct 2 and a decrease of circulation air, caused by the fluff solidified on the multi-channel evaporator 34 in the related art are avoided.According to the present invention, the multi-channel evaporator and the tube-fin evaporator are in parallel connection, the clothes dryer further includes a resistance element in series connection with the tube-fin evaporator and configured to increase a flow resistance of the refrigerant.Specifically, the resistance element is configured as a capillary tube, a counterbalance valve, a pressure regulating valve or an electronic expansion valve.Specifically, the resistance element is located at an outlet side of the tube-fin evaporator.According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, a flowing direction of the refrigerant between the multi-channel evaporator and the tube-fin evaporator is reverse to a flowing direction of the air in the air duct, and the multi-channel evaporator includes a plurality of rows of heat exchange tubes, optionally flat tubes, in which a flowing direction of the refrigerant between the plurality of rows of heat exchange tubes is reverse to the flowing direction of the air in the air duct.According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, the multi-channel evaporator is disposed obliquely with respect to a horizontal plane.According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, the multi-channel evaporator is configured as a parallel flow multi-channel evaporator or a snakelike multi-channel evaporator.According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, a distance between a fin and an adjacent fin of the tube-fin evaporator has a value range of 0.5mm-5mm.According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, the flat tubes of the multi-channel evaporator are disposed at an included angle having a value range of 60-90° relative to the horizontal plane.According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, a flat tube of the multi-channel evaporator has a width of 8-30mm.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSThese and other aspects and advantages of embodiments of the present invention will become apparent and more readily appreciated from the following descriptions made with reference to the drawings, in which:Fig. 1 is a schematic view of a condenser with a tube-fin evaporator and a multi-channel evaporator according to some examples not forming part of the invention;Fig. 2 is a schematic view of a partial structure of a clothes dryer according to some examples not forming part of the invention;Fig. 3 is a schematic view of a clothes dryer according to some examples not forming part of the invention;Fig. 4 is a schematic view of a condenser with a tube-fin evaporator and a multi-channel evaporator according to some embodiments of the present invention;Fig. 5 is a schematic view of a partial structure of a clothes dryer according to some embodiments of the present invention;Fig. 6 is a schematic view of a clothes dryer according to some embodiments of the present invention;Fig. 7 is a schematic view of a condenser with a tube-fin evaporator and a multi-channel evaporator according to some further embodiments of the present invention;Fig. 8 is a schematic view of a clothes dryer according to some further embodiments of the present invention.Reference numerals:clothes dryer 100;drying drum 1; air outlet 12; return air inlet 11; air duct 2;compressor 31; gas outlet 311; return gas inlet 312; condenser 32; throttling element 33; multi-channel evaporator 34; tube-fin evaporator 35; resistance element 351;casing 4.DETAILED DESCRIPTIONReference will be made in detail to embodiments of the present invention.

The clothes dryer 100 may be used for drying clothes, towels and the like. It should be noted herein that, the clothes dryer 100 may be configured to have merely a single drying function, and certainly the clothes dryer 100 may also be configured to have drying and washing functions at the same time.As shown in Figs. 1-8, the clothes dryer 100 includes a casing 4, a drying drum 1 and a heat pump system. In which, the drying drum 1 and the heat pump system is disposed in the casing 4 at the same time. On one hand, the casing 4 may play a role in supporting the drying drum 1 and the heat pump system, and on the other hand, the casing 4 may also play a role in optimizing an appearance of the clothes dryer 100.The drying drum 1 is provided with a drying cavity therein, clothes and towels and the like to be dried may be put in the drying cavity. Specifically, the drying drum 1 is provided with an air outlet 12 and a return air inlet 11 which are in communication with the drying cavity. Air may enter the drying cavity from the return air inlet 11 and flow out of the drying cavity from the air outlet 12.An air duct 2 is defined between the drying drum 1 and the casing 4. Two ends of the air duct 2 are in communication with the return air inlet 11 and the air outlet 12 respectively. Thus, air in the air duct 2 may enter the drying cavity from the return air inlet 11, so as to dry the clothes, towels and the like in the drying cavity. Subsequently the air may be discharged out from the air outlet 12.The heat pump system includes a compressor 31, a condenser 32, a throttling element 33, a multi-channel evaporator 34 and a tube-fin evaporator 35 forming a circulation loop of refrigerants.Thus, by integrating the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 with the clothes dryer 100 at the same time, a heat exchange effect of the evaporator may be improved, so as to improve drying efficiency of the clothes dryer 100.The condenser 32, the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 are disposed in the air duct 2. In a flowing direction of the air in the air duct 2, the tube-fin evaporator 35 is located upstream of the multi-channel evaporator 34. Thus, the wet air discharged out from the air outlet 12 may run through the tube-fin evaporator 35 firstly and exchange heat with the tube-fin evaporator 35, then continue to flow through the multi-channel evaporator 34. In this way, the fluff in the air discharged out from the air outlet 12 accumulates on the tube-fin evaporator 35 1 not on the multi-channel evaporator 34, not only the fluff on the tube-fin evaporator 35 is easy to clean, but also the multi-channel evaporator 34 is easy to clean, and at the same time the problems, such as an increase of resistance of heat transfer between the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the air, a decrease of heat transfer coefficient of the multi-channel evaporator 34, an increase of wind resistance in the air duct 2 and a decrease of circulation air, caused by the fluff solidified on the multi-channel evaporator 34 in the related art are avoided.Specifically, the compressor 31 has a gas outlet 311 and a return gas inlet 312. After heat exchange, the refrigerant may return to the compressor 31 from the return gas inlet 312, and after being compressed by the compressor 31, the refrigerant may be discharged out from the gas outlet 311.One end (for example, a left end shown in Figs. 2, 5 and 8) of the condenser 32 is connected to the gas outlet 311 of the compressor 31, the other end (for example, a right end shown in Figs. 2, 5 and 8) of the condenser 32 is connected to the throttling element 33. The refrigerant discharged out from the gas outlet 311 of the compressor 31 may flow to the condenser 32, and the refrigerant exchanges heat with the surrounding air in the condenser 32 so as to raise the temperature of the surrounding air, subsequently the refrigerant flows to the throttling element 33 which may throttle the refrigerant and reduce pressure of the refrigerant.As shown in Fig. 1-Fig. 8, the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 are in parallel connection or in series connection.Specifically, in examples not forming part of the invention, when the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 are in series connection, one end (for example a right end shown in Fig. 3) of the tube-fin evaporator 35 is connected to one end (for example a left end shown in Fig. 3) of the multi-channel evaporator 34, the other end (for example the left end shown in Fig. 3) ofthe tube-fin evaporator 35 is connected to the return gas inlet 312, and the other end (for example the right end shown in Fig. 3) of the multi-channel evaporator 34 is connected to the throttling element 33. The refrigerant at a high temperature and high pressure discharged out from the gas outlet 311 of the compressor 31 may flow to the condenser 32, and the refrigerant exchanges heat with the surrounding air in the condenser 32 so as to raise the temperature of the surrounding air. After heat exchange, the refrigerant flows to the throttling element 33, and after throttling and pressure reduction by the throttling element 33, the refrigerant then flows to the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 in sequence. The refrigerant exchanges heat with the surrounding air in the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 so as to condense the water vapor in the surrounding wet air, and subsequently the refrigerant returns to the compressor 31 through the return gas inlet 312 of the compressor 31, so as to form the refrigerant circulation. The air in the air duct 2 becomes hot air after exchanging heat with the condenser 32 and flows into the drying cavity through the return air inlet 11 so as to dry the clothes, towel and the like in the drying cavity, the hot air takes the moisture in the clothes, towel and the like away, becomes wet air and is discharged out from the air outlet 12. The wet air discharged out from the air outlet 12 firstly runs through the tube-fin evaporator 35 and exchanges heat with the tube-fin evaporator 35, and subsequently continues to flow through the multi-channel evaporator 34 and exchanges heat with the multi-channel evaporator 34, so as to condense the water vapor in the wet air into the condensed water, and then the dry air continues to flow to the condenser 32, so as to form the circulation in the air duct.According to the invention the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 are in parallel connection, the throttling element 33 is connected to one end (for example the right end shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 8) of the tube-fin evaporator 35 and one end (for example the right end shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 8) of the multi-channel evaporator 34 at the same time, and the return gas inlet 312 is connected to the other end (for example the left end shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 8) of the tube-fin evaporator 35 and the other end (for example the left end shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 8) of the multi-channel evaporator 34 at the same time. The refrigerant at a high temperature and high pressure discharged out from the gas outlet 311 of the compressor 31 flows to the condenser 32, and the refrigerant exchanges heat with the surrounding air in the condenser 32 so as to raise the temperature of the surrounding air. After heat exchange, the refrigerant flows to the throttling element 33, and after throttling and pressure reduction by the throttling element 33, the refrigerant then flows to the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 at the same time. The refrigerant exchanges heat with the surrounding air in the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 so as to condense the water vapor in the surrounding wet air, and subsequently the refrigerant is discharged out from the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 and returns to the compressor 31 through the return gas inlet 312 of the compressor 31, so as to form the refrigerant circulation. The air in the air duct 2 becomes hot air after exchanging heat with the condenser 32 and flows into the drying cavity through the return air inlet 11 so as to dry the clothes, towel and the like in the drying cavity, the hot air takes the moisture in the clothes, towel and the like away, becomes wet air and is discharged out from the air outlet 12. The wet air discharged out from the air outlet 12 firstly runs through the tube-fin evaporator 35 and exchanges heat with the tube-fin evaporator 35, and subsequently continues to flow through the multi-channel evaporator 34 and exchanges heat with the multi-channel evaporator 34, so as to condense the water vapor in the wet air, and then the dry air continues to flow to the condenser 32, so as to form the circulation in the air duct.In the clothes dryer 100 according to embodiments of the present invention, the heat pump system includes the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 at the same time, the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 are in parallel connection, the condenser 32, the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 are disposed in the air duct 2, moreover in the flowing direction of the air of the air duct 2, the tube-fin evaporator 35 is located upstream of the multi-channel evaporator 34. Thus, by disposing the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 at the same time, the heat exchange efficiency of the evaporator may be improved, which facilitates improvement of the working efficiency of the clothes dryer 100. Moreover in the flowing direction of the air of the air duct 2, the tube-fin evaporator 35 is located upstream of the multi-channel evaporator 34, thus the wet air discharged out from the air outlet 12 may firstly run through the tube-fin evaporator 35 and exchange heat with the tube-fin evaporator 35, and then subsequently continue to flow through the multi-channel evaporator 34. By this way, the fluff in the air discharged out from the air outlet 12 accumulates on the tube-fin evaporator 35 not on the multi-channel evaporator 34, not only the fluff on the tube-fin evaporator 35 is easy to clean, but also the multi-channel evaporator 34 is easy to clean, and at the same time the problems, such as an increase of resistance of heat transfer between the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the air, a decrease of heat transfer coefficient of themulti-channel evaporator 34, an increase of wind resistance in the air duct 2 and a decrease of circulation air, caused by the fluff solidified on the multi-channel evaporator 34 in the related art are avoided.Specifically, a water container (not shown in the drawings) may be disposed under the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35, so as to collect the condensed water generated by the wet air running through the tube-fin evaporator 35 and the multi-channel evaporator 34. Furthermore, the clothes dryer 100 also includes a water tank (not shown in the drawings), the water tank is disposed above the tube-fin evaporator 35 and the multi-channel evaporator 34. Water in the water container may flow into the water tank, and when the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 need to be cleaned, water in the water tank may be sprayed on the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 under an action of gravity, so as to clean the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35.In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the clothes dryer 100 further includes a fan (not shown). The fan may blow the air in the air duct 2 to the condenser 32 so as to expedite the heat exchange between the condenser 32 and the air, so that after heat exchange, the air can conveniently flow to the drying cavity through the return air inlet 11, thereby improving the drying efficiency of the clothes dryer 100.According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, as shown in Fig. 7-Fig. 8, the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 are in parallel connection, the clothes dryer 100 further includes a resistance element 351 which is in series connection with the tube-fin evaporator 35 and configured to increase the flow resistance of the refrigerant. Specifically, when the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 are in parallel connection, the refrigerant in the multi-channel evaporator 34 has a flow resistance different from that in the tube-fin evaporator 35. In general, the refrigerant in the multi-channel evaporator 34 has a flow resistance greater than that in the tube-fin evaporator 35, and as the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 are in parallel connection, the refrigerant flux in the multi-channel evaporator 34 is lower. The resistance element 351 is configured to reduce the refrigerant flux in the tube-fin evaporator 35, so that the refrigerant fluxes in the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 are equilibrated, thereby further optimizing the effects of heat exchange in the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35.Specifically, the resistance element 351 may be configured as a capillary tube, a counterbalance valve, a pressure regulating valve or an electronic expansion valve, thus the structure is simple and reliable.Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 8, the resistance element 351 is located at an outlet side of the tube-fin evaporator 35. Certainly, the present disclosure is not limited to this. In other embodiments, the resistance element 351 may also be disposed at other positions of the tube-fin evaporator 35, for example the resistance element 351 may be located at an inlet side of the tube-fin evaporator 35 as long as the resistance element 351 can increase the flow resistance of the refrigerant in the tube-fin evaporator 35.According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, in the flowing direction of the air in the air duct, an inlet end of the tube-fin evaporator 35 is located downstream of an outlet end of the tube-fin evaporator 35, and an inlet end of the multi-channel evaporator 34 is located downstream of an outlet end of the multi-channel evaporator 34. Thus, both the flowing directions of the refrigerant in the tube-fin evaporator 35 and in the multi-channel evaporator 34 are reverse to the flowing direction of the air in the air duct 2. Specifically, the general flowing direction of the refrigerant in the tube-fin evaporator 35 and in the multi-channel evaporator 34 is roughly reverse to the general flowing direction of the air in the air duct 2, and the flowing direction of the refrigerant between the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 is reverse to the flowing direction of the air in the air duct. For example, the multi-channel evaporator 34 includes a plurality of rows of heat exchange tubes such as flat tubes, and the flowing direction of the refrigerant among the plurality of rows of heat exchange tubes is reverse to the flowing direction of the air in the air duct. The tube-fin evaporator 35 includes a plurality of rows of heat exchange tubes, and the flowing direction of the refrigerant among the plurality of rows of heat exchange tubes is reverse to the flowing direction of the air in the air duct, which facilitates improvement of the effect of heat exchange between the air and the tube-fin evaporator 35 and between the air and the multi-channel evaporator 34.In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the multi-channel evaporator 34 is disposed obliquely with respect to a horizontal plane, so that the multi-channel evaporator 34 is easy to clean.Optionally, the multi-channel evaporator 34 is configured as a parallel flow multi-channel evaporator 34 or a snakelike multi-channel evaporator 34, thus the structure is simple and reliable.According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, a distance between a fin and an adjacent fin of the tube-fin evaporator 35 has a value range of 0.5mm-5mm. Preferably, the distance between the fin and the adjacent fins of the tube-fin evaporator 35 has a value range of 1mm-1.5mm.Specifically, the fin of the tube-fin evaporator 35 may be configured as a flat fin, a wavy fin, a louvered fin or a slit fin. Preferably, the fin of the tube-fin evaporator 35 may be configured as a flat fin.Optionally, the tube-fin evaporator 35 may have 1-5 rows of the tubes. Preferably, the tube-fin evaporator 35 has 1-2 rows of the tubes.It should be noted that, all the other structures and relevant parameters of the tube-fin evaporator 35 are the prior art, which will not be elaborated herein.In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the flat tubes of the multi-channel evaporator 34 are disposed at an included angle having a value range of 60-90° relative to the horizontal plane. Specifically, the flat tubes of the multi-channel evaporator 34 are disposed at the included angle having the value range of 60-90° relative to the horizontal plane, and the flat tubes of the multi-channel evaporator 34 are disposed along a flowing direction of the air. Optionally, the multi-channel evaporator 34 may have 1-4 rows of flat tubes. Preferably, the multi-channel evaporator 34 has 2-3 rows of flat tubes.Optionally, the flat tube of the multi-channel evaporator 34 may have a width of 8-30mm. Preferably, the flat tube of the multi-channel evaporator 34 has the width of 12-20mm.Specifically, the multi-channel evaporator 34 includes a header, and the flat pipes are fixed to the header. Optionally, the header is disposed along the horizontal direction.Optionally, the multi-channel evaporator 34 has 10-18 fins per 2.54cm (per inch). Preferably, the multi-channel evaporator 34 has 12.7 or 14 fins per 2.54cm (per inch).It should be noted that, all the other structures and relevant parameters of the multi-channel evaporator 34 are the prior art, which will not be elaborated herein.The specific structures of the clothes dryer 100 according to embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail in the following with reference to Figs. 1-8.Example not forming part of the inventionAs shown in Figs. 1-3, the clothes dryer 100 according to an example not forming part of the invention includes the casing 4, the drying drum 1, the water tank, the fan and the heat pumpsystem. In which, the drying drum 1, the fan, the water tank and the heat pump system are all disposed in the casing 4 at the same time.The drying cavity is disposed in the drying drum 1, and the clothes, towels and the like to be dried may be put in the drying cavity. Specifically, the drying drum 1 is provided with the air outlet 12 and the return air inlet 11 which are in communication with the drying cavity. The air may enter the drying cavity from the return air inlet 11 and flow out of the drying cavity from the air outlet 12.The air duct 2 is defined between the drying drum 1 and the casing 4. Two ends of the air duct 2 are in communication with the return air inlet 11 and the air outlet 12 respectively. Thus, the air in the air duct 2 may enter the drying cavity from the return air inlet 11, so as to dry the clothes, towels and the like in the drying cavity. Subsequently the air may be discharged out from the air outlet 12.The heat pump system includes the compressor 31, the condenser 32, the throttling element 33, the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 forming the circulation loop of refrigerants. Thus, by integrating the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 on the clothes dryer 100 at the same time, the heat exchange effect of the evaporator may be improved, being beneficial for improving the drying efficiency of the clothes dryer 100.The fan, the condenser 32, the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 are disposed in the air duct 2. In the flowing direction of the air in the air duct 2, the tube-fin evaporator 35 is located upstream of the multi-channel evaporator 34. Thus, the wet air discharged out from the air outlet 12 may run through the tube-fin evaporator 35 firstly and exchange heat with the tube-fin evaporator 35, then continue to flow through the multi-channel evaporator 34. In this way, the fluff in the air discharged out from the air outlet 12 accumulates on the tube-fin evaporator 35 not on the multi-channel evaporator 34, not only the fluff on the tube-fin evaporator 35 is easy to clean, but also the multi-channel evaporator 34 is easy to clean, and at the same time the problems, such as an increase of resistance of heat transfer between the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the air, a decrease of heat transfer coefficient of the multi-channel evaporator 34, an increase of wind resistance in the air duct 2 and a decrease of circulation air, caused by the fluff that is solidified on the multi-channel evaporator 34 in the related art are avoided..Specifically, the compressor 31 has the gas outlet 311 and the return gas inlet 312. After heat exchange, the refrigerant may return to the compressor 31 from the return gas inlet 312, and after compression by the compressor 31, the refrigerant may be discharged out from the gas outlet 311.One end of the condenser 32 is connected to the gas outlet 311 of the compressor 31, the other end of the condenser 32 is connected to the throttling element 33, thus, the refrigerant discharged out from the gas outlet 311 of the compressor 31 may flow to the condenser 32, and the refrigerant exchanges heat with the surrounding air in the condenser 32 so as to raise the temperature of the surrounding air, subsequently the refrigerant flows to the throttling element 33 which throttles the refrigerant and reduces the pressure of the refrigerant.As shown in Fig. 3, the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 are in series connection. Specifically, one end of the tube-fin evaporator 35 is connected to one end of the multi-channel evaporator 34, the other end of the tube-fin evaporator 35 is connected to the return gas inlet 312, and the other end of the multi-channel evaporator 34 is connected to the throttling element 33. The refrigerant at a high temperature and high pressure discharged out from the gas outlet 311 of the compressor 31 flows to the condenser 32, and the refrigerant exchanges heat with the surrounding air in the condenser 32 so as to raise the temperature of the surrounding air. After heat exchange, the refrigerant flows to the throttling element 33, and after throttling and pressure reduction by the throttling element 33, the refrigerant then flows to the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 in sequence. The refrigerant exchanges heat with the surrounding air in the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 so as to condense the water vapor in the surrounding wet air, and subsequently the refrigerant returns to the compressor 31 through the return gas inlet 312 of the compressor 31, so as to form the refrigerant circulation. The air in the air duct 2 becomes hot air after exchanging heat with the condenser 32 and flows into the drying cavity through the return air inlet 11 so as to dry the clothes, towels and the like in the drying cavity, the hot air takes the moisture in the clothes, towels and the like away and becomes the wet air which is discharged out from the air outlet 12. The wet air discharged out from the air outlet 12 firstly runs through the tube-fin evaporator 35 and exchanges heat with the tube-fin evaporator 35, and subsequently continues to flow through the multi-channel evaporator 34 and exchanges heat with the multi-channel evaporator 34, so as to condense the water vapor in the wet air into the condensed water, and then the dry air continues to flow to the condenser 32, so as to form the circulation in the air duct.Specifically, the water container (not shown in the drawings) is disposed under the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35, so as to collect the condensed water generated by the wet air running through the tube-fin evaporator 35 and the multi-channel evaporator 34. The water tank is disposed above the tube-fin evaporator 35 and the multi-channel evaporator 34. Water in the water container may flow into the water tank, and when the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 need to be cleaned, water in the water tank may be sprayed on the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 under the action of gravity, so as to clean the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35.The fan may blow the air in the air duct 2 to the condenser 32 so as to expedite the heat exchange between the condenser 32 and the air, so that after heat exchange, the air can conveniently flow to the drying cavity through the return air inlet 11, thereby improving the drying efficiency of the clothes dryer 100.Specifically, both the flowing directions of the refrigerant in the tube-fin evaporator 35 and in the multi-channel evaporator 34 are reverse to the flowing direction of the air in the air duct 2, which facilitates improvement of the effect of the heat exchange between the air and the tube-fin evaporator 35 and between the air and the multi-channel evaporator 34.The multi-channel evaporator 34 is disposed obliquely with respect to the horizontal plane, so that the multi-channel evaporator 34 is easy to clean.Specifically, the multi-channel evaporator 34 is configured as the parallel flow multi-channel evaporator 34 or the snakelike multi-channel evaporator 34, thus the structure is simple and reliable.Embodiment 1As shown in Figs. 4-6, the clothes dryer 100 according to the embodiment of the present invention includes the casing 4, the drying drum 1, the water tank, the fan and the heat pump system.

After heat exchange, the refrigerant may return to the compressor 31 from the return gas inlet 312, and after compression by the compressor 31, the refrigerant may be discharged out from the gas outlet 311.One end of the condenser 32 is connected to the gas outlet 311 of the compressor 31, the other end of the condenser 32 is connected to the throttling element 33, thus, the refrigerant discharged out from the gas outlet 311 of the compressor 31 may flow to the condenser 32, and the refrigerant exchanges heat with the surrounding air in the condenser 32 so as to raise the temperature of the surrounding air, subsequently the refrigerant flows to the throttling element 33 which throttles the refrigerant and reduces the pressure of the refrigerant.As shown in Fig. 6, the multi-channel evaporator 34 and the tube-fin evaporator 35 are inparallel connection. Specifically, the throttling element 33 is connected to one end of the tube-fin evaporator 35 and one end of the multi-channel evaporator 34 at the same time, and the return gas inlet 312 is connected to the other end of the tube-fin evaporator 35 and the other end of the multi-channel evaporator 34 at the same time.

      "3  [Technical FieldThe present invention relates to a diplexer.Background ArtDevices that employ frequency division duplexing (FDD), such as radio communication equipment and radar devices, are required to transmit and receive high frequency signals (which are, for example, microwaves or millimeter waves) via a single antenna circuit shared by a transmitter circuit and a receiver circuit. To fulfill this requirement, a diplexer is used.A diplexer is constituted by: converter sections which are interfaces for connection with a transmitter circuit, a receiver circuit, and an antenna circuit; directional coupler sections for coupling between a first waveguide and a second waveguide; and filters that determine a frequency band of high frequency signals to be passed. For example, Non-Patent Literature 1 discloses techniques for realizing a diplexer, in Figure 18.35 thereof. Specifically, Non-Patent Literature 1 discloses combining (1) a filter pair constituted by two band-pass filters (\"Rx filter\" in Figure 18.35) arranged next to each other, (2) a directional coupler section (\"90° hybrid\" in Figure 18.35) provided on a first side of the filter pair, and (3) a directional coupler section (\"90° hybrid\" in Figure 18.35) provided on a second side of the filter pair.In this diplexer, the directional coupler section on the first side includes an antenna port and a Tx port, and the directional coupler section on the second side includes an Rx port. The antenna port is for connecting an antenna which transmits outgoing waves and receives incoming waves. The Tx port is for connecting a transmitter circuit which transmits outgoing waves. The Rx port is for connecting a receiver circuit which receives incoming waves.Citation List[Non-patent Literature][Non-patent Literature 1]Richard J. Cameron et al., MICROWAVE FILTERS for COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, p.661-663, 2007 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.Summary of InventionTechnical ProblemHowever, the conventional diplexer disclosed in Figure 18.35 of Non-Patent Literature 1 has the problem of insufficient isolation between the Tx port and Rx port. FDD involves transmitting outgoing waves simultaneously with reception of incoming waves. In devices that employ FDD, such as radio communication equipment and radar devices, insufficient isolation between the Tx port and the Rx port means that incoming waves will be buried by the outgoing waves. In other words, the receiver circuit will be unable to process the incoming waves. This is because the strength of incoming waves received by the antenna is much lower than the strength of outgoing waves transmitted by the transmitter circuit.An object of an aspect of the present invention lies in achieving greater isolation between (i) a port which can be used as a Tx port and (ii) a port which can be used as an Rx port in a diplexer that includes ports which can be used as an antenna port, a Tx port, and an Rx port.Solution to Problem In order to solve the above problem, a diplexer in accordance with an aspect of the present invention includes: a filter pair constituted by (i) a first filter including a first port and a second port and (ii) a second filter including a first port and a second port, the first filter and the second filter each having a passband that is a first frequency band, the first filter and the second filter being arranged next to each other; a first directional coupler section including a first port and a second port arranged next to each other and a third port and a fourth port arranged next to each other, the first port of the first directional coupler section being connected to the first port of the first filter, the second port of the first directional coupler section being connected to the first port of the second filter; a second directional coupler section including a first port and a second port arranged next to each other and a third port and a fourth port arranged next to each other, the first port of the second directional coupler section being connected to the second port of the first filter, the second port of the second directional coupler section being connected to the second port of the second filter; and a third filter having a passband that is a second frequency band differing from the first frequency band, the third filter including a first port and a second port, the first port of the third filter being connected to the third port of the first directional coupler section.Advantageous Effects of InventionAn aspect of the present invention makes it possible to achieve greater isolation between (i) a port which can be used as a Tx port and (ii) a port which can be used as an Rx port in a diplexer that includes ports which can be used as an antenna port, a Tx port, and an Rx port.Brief Description of DrawingsFig. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a diplexer in accordance with Embodiment 1 of the present invention.(a) Fig. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a first connection example in the diplexer of Fig. 1.

Fig. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a diplexer 1 in accordance with Embodiment 1. (a) Fig. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a first connection example in the diplexer 1. (b) of Fig. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a second connection example in the diplexer 1.(Configuration of diplexer 1)As illustrated in Fig. 1, the diplexer 1 includes a filter pair 11, a directional coupler section 21, a directional coupler section 31, and a band-pass filter (BPF) 41. The directional coupler section 21 corresponds to the \"first directional coupler section\" recited in the claims, and the directional coupler section 31 corresponds to the \"second directional coupler section\" recited in the claims. The BPF 41 corresponds to the \"third filter\" recited in the claims.The filter pair 11 includes a BPF 12 (corresponding to the \"first filter\" recited in the claims) and a BPF 13 (corresponding to the \"second filter\" recited in the claims) which are arranged next to each other. The BPF 12 includes a first port 121 and a second port 122. The BPF 13 includes a first port 131 and a second port 132. The BPF 41 includes a first port 411 and a second port 412. The BPF 12 and the BPF 13 have a passband which is a first frequency band. The BPF 41 has a passband which is a second frequency band that differs from the first frequency band. The radio wave passbands of the BPF 12, the BPF 13, and the BPF 41 will be described later.The directional coupler section 21 includes a first port 211, a second port 212, a third port 213, and a fourth port 214. The first port 211 and the second port 212 are arranged next to each other. The third port 213 and the fourth port 214 are arranged next to each other. The first port 211 is connected to the first port 121 of the BPF 12. The second port 212 is connected to the first port 131 of the BPF 13. The third port 213 is connected to the first port 411 of the BPF 41.The directional coupler section 31 includes a first port 311, a second port 312, a third port 313, and a fourth port 314. The first port 311 and the second port 312 are arranged next to each other. The third port 313 and the fourth port 314 are arranged next to each other. The first port 311 is connected to the second port 122 of the BPF 12. The second port 312 is connected to the second port 132 of the BPF 13.In Embodiment 1, the port 214 of the directional coupler section 21 is referred to as a first port P1 of the diplexer 1, the port 412 of the BPF 41 is referred to as a second port P2 of the diplexer 1, the port 313 of the directional coupler section 31 is referred to as a third port P3 of the diplexer 1, and the port 314 of the directional coupler section 31 is referred to as a fourth port P4 of the diplexer 1.(Connection examples)(a) of Fig. 2 illustrates a first connection example of the diplexer 1. As illustrated in (a) of Fig. 2, the diplexer 1 can be used in a state where an antenna 101 is connected to the first port P1, a receiver circuit (Rx) 102 is connected to the second port P2, and a transmitter circuit (Tx) 103 is connected to the third port P3. Note that the fourth port P4 is terminated with use of a terminal section 70. The terminal section 70 is described later with reference to Fig. 6.In a case where the diplexer 1 is used in a state where the antenna 101, the Rx 102, and the Tx 103 are connected to the diplexer 1 as in the first connection example, the passband of the BPF 12 and BPF 13 which constitute the filter pair 11 encompasses a frequency band of outgoing waves transmitted from the Tx 103, and the passband of the BPF 41 encompasses the frequency band of incoming waves received by the Rx 102.Hereinafter, out of a frequency band of not less than 70 GHz to less than 90 GHz (commonly known as an \"E band\"), a frequency band of not less than 70 GHz to less than 80 GHz is referred to as a \"low band\", and a frequency band of not less than 80 GHz to less than 90 GHz is referred to as a \"high band\". Assume a case where the first frequency band, which is the frequency band of incoming waves received by the Rx 102, falls within the high band, and the second frequency band, which is the frequency band of outgoing waves transmitted by the Tx 103, falls within the low band. In such a case, the BPF 41 can be configured such that the passband of the BPF 41 is the first frequency falling within the high band, and the BPF 12 and BPF 13 can be configured such that the passband of the BPF 12 and BPF 13 is the second frequency band falling within the low band. One possible example of the first frequency band is an 81-86 GHz band (center frequency: 83.5 GHz), and one possible example of the second frequency band is a 71-76 GHz band (center frequency: 73.5 GHz).Next, assume a case where, conversely, the first frequency band falls within the low band, and the second frequency band falls within the high band. In such a case, the BPF 41 can be configured such that the passband of the BPF 41 is the first frequency falling within the low band, and the BPF 12 and BPF 13 can be configured such that the passband of the BPF 12 and BPF 13 is the second frequency falling within the high band. One possible example of the first frequency band is a 71-76 GHz band (center frequency: 73.5 GHz), and one possible example of the second frequency band is an 81-86 GHz band (center frequency: 83.5 GHz).Configuring the diplexer 1 to include the BPF 41 makes it possible to achieve greater isolation between the second port P2 and the third port P3 as compared to a conventional diplexer.Note that even in a case where, as in the second connection example illustrated in (b) of Fig. 2, the transmitter circuit Tx is connected to the second port P2 and the receiver circuit Rx is connected to the third port P3, the diplexer 1 can still achieve greater isolation between the second port P2 and the third port P3 as compared to a conventional diplexer.In a case where the diplexer 1 is used in a state where the antenna 101, the Rx 102, and the Tx 103 are connected to the diplexer 1 as in the second connection example, the BPF 12 and BPF 13 can be configured to have a passband which encompasses the incoming waves, and the BPF 41 can be configured to have a passband which encompasses the outgoing waves.[Embodiment 2]The following description will discuss a diplexer in accordance with Embodiment 2 of the present invention, with reference to Figs. 3 to 6. A diplexer 1 in accordance with Embodiment 2 is a first example configuration of the diplexer 1 in accordance with Embodiment 1. The diplexer 1 of Embodiment 2 utilizes a post-wall waveguide technique. In the following descriptions, \"diplexer 1\" refers to the diplexer 1 of Embodiment 2 unless stated otherwise. Fig. 3 is a perspective view of the diplexer 1. Fig. 4 is a plan view of the diplexer 1. (a) of Fig. 5 is a plan view of converter sections 50A and 50B of the diplexer 1. (b) of Fig. 5 is a cross-sectional view of the converter section 50A, taken along line DD in (a) of Fig. 5. (a) of Fig. 6 is a plan view of a terminal section 70 of the diplexer 1. (b) of Fig. 6 is a cross-sectional view of the terminal section 70, taken along line EE of (a) of Fig. 6.(Configuration of diplexer 1)As illustrated in Fig. 3, the diplexer 1 includes: a substrate 2 which is a single dielectric substrate; a conductor layer 3; a conductor layer 4; and a dielectric layer 5.The substrate 2 is a single substrate made of quartz, and is shared by the filter pair 11, the directional coupler section 21, the directional coupler section 31, and the BPF 41. The substrate 2 has six surfaces. In the following descriptions, out of these six surfaces, the two surfaces having the largest area are referred to as the main surfaces of the substrate 2. Note that the material for the substrate 2 is not limited to quartz, and may be a glass material other than quartz, a resin material such as polytetrafluoroethylene (for example, the material known as Teflon (registered trademark)) or a liquid crystal polymer, or a ceramic material.The substrate 2 has regularly arranged through-holes each passing through the substrate 2 from front to back of the substrate 2. The through-holes each have a tube-shaped metal (e.g., copper) conductor film on the inner wall thereof. That is, the through-holes each have a metal conductor post formed inside thereof. In Embodiment 2, the diameter of each conductor post is 100 microns, and the distance between adjacent conductor posts (distance between the centers of adjacent conductor posts) is 200 microns.Conductor posts regularly arranged in the above fence-like manner serve as post walls that reflect high frequency signals which are electromagnetic waves propagating through the substrate 2. In other words, the post walls serve as a kind of conductor wall. These conductor posts constitute narrow walls of the filter pair 11, the directional coupler sections 21 and 31, and the BPF 41. The layouts of the post walls for the filter pair 11, the directional coupler sections 21 and 31, and the BPF 41 will be described later with reference to another diagram.The conductor layer 3 and the conductor layer 4 are a pair of conductor layers provided on opposite sides of the substrate 2. That is, the conductor layer 3 and the conductor layer 4 are each provided on a respective one of the two main surfaces of the substrate 2. The substrate 2, the conductor layer 3, and the conductor layer 4 have a laminated structure in which the substrate 2 is sandwiched between the conductor layers 3 and 4. In Embodiment 2, copper is used as a conductor constituting the conductor layers 3 and 4, but a different conductor (for example, a metal such as aluminum) may be used. The thickness of the conductor layers 3 and 4 is not limited to a particular thickness, and can be discretionarily chosen. In other words, the conductor layers 3 and 4 may be provided in the form of thin films, foil (films), or plates.The respective waveguides of the filter pair 11, the directional coupler sections 21 and 31, and the BPF 41 each have the conductor layer 3 as a first wide wall and the conductor layer 4 as a second wide wall. The conductor layers 3 and 4 correspond to the \"pair of conductor layers\" recited in the claims.As described above, four of the six faces of each of the filter pair 11 are constituted by the aforementioned narrow walls and the aforementioned pair of wide walls, four of the six faces of each of the directional coupler sections 21 and 31 are constituted by the aforementioned narrow walls and the aforementioned pair of wide walls, and four of the six faces of the BPF 41 are constituted by the aforementioned narrow walls and the aforementioned pair of wide walls.The dielectric layer 5 is a conductor layer made of a polyimide resin and disposed on a surface of the conductor layer 3 (first wide wall). The material for the dielectric layer 5 may be a resin material other than polyimide resin.With reference to Fig. 4, the following description will discuss details of the configurations of the filter pair 11, the directional coupler sections 21 and 31, and the BPF 41 of the diplexer 1.(Filter pair 11)As described above with reference to Fig. 1, the filter pair 11 is made up of the BPF 12, which is the first filter, and the BPF 13, which is the second filter, the BPF 12 and the BPF 13 being arranged next to each other. The BPF 12 and the BPF 13 share a narrow wall 14. The BPF 12 includes a narrow wall 123 facing the narrow wall 14. Similarly, the BPF 13 includes a narrow wall 133 facing the narrow wall 14.(BPF 12)The BPF 12 is a kind of waveguide (rectangular waveguide), four of whose faces are respectively constituted by the conductor layers 3 and 4 (which constitute a pair of wide walls) and the narrow walls 14 and 123 (which are a pair of narrow walls). The BPF 12 is designed to have a passband that is the first frequency band.The BPF 12 is formed by six faces, two of which (opposite end faces of the BPF 12, i.e., the faces other than those constituted by the conductor layers 3 and 4 and the narrow walls 14 and 123) serve as a first port 121 and a second port 122, respectively, for electromagnetic connection between the BPF 12 and members outside the BPF 12. Hereinafter, the first port 121 and the second port 122 may also be referred to simply as a port 121 and a port 122, respectively.As illustrated in Fig. 4, six partition walls 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d, 12e, and 12f are provided inside the BPF 12. Each of the partition walls 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d, 12e, and 12f is oriented so as to be disposed in a plane that intersects (perpendicularly, in Embodiment 2) with each of the conductor layers 3 and 4 and that intersects (perpendicularly, in Embodiment 2) with each of the narrow walls 14 and 123. In other words, each of the partition walls 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d, 12e, and 12f is formed in a zx plane, in terms of the coordinate system shown in Fig. 4.The partition walls 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d, 12e, and 12f divide the BPF 12 into seven sections. These seven sections are (i) a section including the port 121, (ii) a section including the port 122, and (iii) five sections which are sandwiched between the section including the port 121 and the section including the port 122. The five sections which are sandwiched each have a rectangular parallelepiped shape whose top and bottom walls are formed by portions of the conductor layers 3 and 4, and whose side walls are formed by (i) a portion of the narrow walls 14 and 123 and (ii) two adjacent partition walls (for example, the partition walls 12a and 12b). As such, the five sections which are sandwiched each serve as a resonator. The five sections which are sandwiched are therefore referred to as resonators 124, 125, 126, 127, and 128, respectively.The partition wall 12a has an opening 12aa. The opening 12aa serves as an inductive window through which (i) the section including the port 121 and (ii) the resonator 124 are electromagnetically coupled. The strength of coupling between the section including the port 121 and the resonator 124 is dependent on the width of the opening 12aa. A greater width of the opening 12aa correlates to a greater strength of this coupling.Similarly to the opening 12aa, the partition wall 12b has an opening 12ba, the partition wall 12c has an opening 12ca, the partition wall 12d has an opening 12da, the partition wall 12e has an opening 12ea, and the partition wall 12f has an opening 12fa. The opening 12ba serves as an inductive window through which the resonator 124 and the resonator 125 are electromagnetically coupled. The opening 12ca serves as an inductive window through which the resonator 125 and the resonator 126 are electromagnetically coupled. The opening 12da serves as an inductive window through which the resonator 126 and the resonator 127 are electromagnetically coupled. The opening 12ea serves as an inductive window through which the resonator 127 and the resonator 128 are electromagnetically coupled. The opening 12fa serves as an inductive window through which the resonator 128 and the port 122 are electromagnetically coupled.The resonator 124 and the resonator 128 correspond to the \"first resonator\" and the \"second resonator\" recited in the claims, respectively. In Embodiment 2, the resonator 124 and the resonator 128 are coupled via the resonators 125 to 127. Note, however, that the diplexer 1 need only include at least two resonators (the resonator 124 and the resonator 128). The resonator 124 and the resonator 128 may be coupled directly to each other, or may be coupled indirectly via one or more other resonators. In other words, the number of resonators included in the diplexer 1 need only be two or more.The passband of the BPF 12 can be controlled by controlling parameters such as the number of resonators in the filter (this number being five in the diplexer 1), the size of each of the resonators, and/or the strength of coupling between adjacent resonators. Adjusting these parameters makes it possible to design a band-pass filter whose passband is the first frequency band (a desired frequency band).Similarly to the narrow walls 14 and 123, each of the partition walls 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d, 12e, and 12f is constituted by conductor posts provided in a fence-like manner. Portions where these conductor posts are omitted serve as the openings 12aa, 12ba, 12ca, 12da, 12ea, and 12fa. The respective widths of the openings 12aa, 12ba, 12ca, 12da, 12ea, and 12fa can be controlled by the number of conductor posts omitted. Furthermore, the position of those conductor posts of the partition walls 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d, 12e, and 12f which define the opposite ends of each of the openings 12aa, 12ba, 12ca, 12da, 12ea, and 12fa can be finely adjusted in accordance with the respective widths (the widths determined at the time of design) of the openings 12aa, 12ba, 12ca, 12da, 12ea, and 12fa.In Embodiment 2, the widths of the openings 12aa, 12ba, 12ca, 12da, 12ea, and 12fa become smaller with increasing distance from the port 121 and the port 122, i.e., become smaller with decreasing distance from the center of the BPF 12.In the BPF 12 configured as described above, when a high frequency signal is externally supplied and coupled to the port 121 and propagates toward the port 122, the BPF 12 allows passage of a component of the high frequency signal which component has a frequency falling within a predetermined frequency band, and the BPF 12 reflects a component of the high frequency signal which component has a frequency not falling within the predetermined frequency band. That is, the BPF 12 serves as a band-pass filter (BPF) that allows passage of high frequency signals whose frequency falls within the predetermined frequency band.(BPF 13)The BPF 13 is configured identically to the BPF 12. Therefore, the following description will only discuss the relationship between the BPF 13 and the BPF 12, and the details of the BPF 13 are omitted.The BPF 13 is a kind of waveguide (rectangular waveguide), four of whose faces are respectively constituted by the conductor layers 3 and 4 (which constitute a pair of wide walls) and the narrow walls 14 and 133 (which are narrow walls).The BPF 13 is formed by six faces, two of which (opposite end faces of the BPF 13, i.e., the faces other than those constituted by the conductor layers 3 and 4 and the narrow walls 14 and 133) serve as a first port 131 and a second port 132, respectively. Hereinafter, the first port 131 and the second port 132 may also be referred to simply as a port 131 and a port 132, respectively.As illustrated in Fig. 4, the narrow wall 133 of the BPF 13 corresponds to the narrow wall 123 of the BPF 12, and the port 131, the port 132, and resonators 134 to 138 of the BPF 13 correspond to the port 121, the port 122, and the resonators 124 to 128 of the BPF 12, respectively. Partition walls 13a, 13b, 13c, 13d, 13e, and 13f, which are six partition walls provided within the BPF 13, correspond to the partition walls 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d, 12e, and 12f of the BPF 12, respectively. The partition walls 13a, 13b, 13c, 13d, 13e, and 13f have openings 13aa, 13ba, 13ca, 13da, 13ea, and 13fa, respectively, which correspond to the openings 12aa, 12ba, 12ca, 12da, 12ea, and 12fa of the BPF 12, respectively.(Directional coupler section 21)As illustrated in Fig. 4, the directional coupler section 21 includes a waveguide 22, which is a first rectangular waveguide, and a waveguide 23, which is a second rectangular waveguide. The waveguide 22 and the waveguide 23 share a narrow wall 24 (first narrow wall) that has an opening 24a in the center of its length. The waveguides 22 and 23 have narrow walls 221 and 231 (second narrow walls), respectively, each of which faces the narrow wall 24. In other words, the waveguide 22 and the waveguide 23 are each a post-wall waveguide in which the narrow walls 221, 231, and 24 are constituted by conductor posts provided in a fence-like manner.A pair of wide walls for the waveguide 22 is constituted by the conductor layers 3 and 4. The narrow wall 24 and the narrow wall 221 for the waveguide 22 are each constituted by conductor posts. Similarly, a pair of wide walls for the waveguide 23 is constituted by the conductor layers 3 and 4. The narrow wall 24 and the narrow wall 231, which are a pair of narrow walls, are each constituted by conductor posts.The conductor posts constituting the narrow walls 221, 231, and 24 are configured similarly to the conductor posts constituting the filter pair 11.The directional coupler section 21 includes a port 211 which is a first port, a port 212 which is a second port, a port 213 which is a third port, and a port 214 which is a fourth port. The port 21 1 is provided at a first end of the waveguide 22, and the port 214 is provided at a second end of the waveguide 22. The port 212 is provided at a first end of the waveguide 23, and the port 213 is provided at a second end of the waveguide 23. In other words, the port 211 and the port 212 are arranged next to each other, and the port 213 and the port 214 are arranged next to each other. The port 211 is connected to the port 121 of the BPF 12, and the port 212 is connected to the port 131 of the BPF 13.Two conductor posts provided at opposite ends of the opening 24a are more widely spaced from each other than other conductor posts. The opening 24a serves as an inductive window through which the waveguide 22 and the waveguide 23 are coupled. The opening 24a formed in the narrow wall 24 causes, for example, a high frequency signal which is coupled to the first port 211 and which propagates from the first port 211 toward the fourth port 214 to be distributed from the waveguide 22 also to the waveguide 23 through the opening 24a. As a result, the high frequency signal coupled to the first port 211 reaches not only the fourth port 214 but also the third port 213.By optimizing parameters such as the width of the opening 24a and the shapes of waveguides 22 and 23, it is possible to achieve a coupling factor of 3 dB between the waveguide 22 and the waveguide 23. The directional coupler section 21 is a 3 dB directional coupler section whose coupling factor is 3 dB. In a 3 dB directional coupler section, in a case where, for example, a high frequency signal is coupled to the first port 211, the electric field strength of the high frequency signal reaching the fourth port 214 and the electric field strength of the high frequency signal reaching the third port 213 are substantially equal to each other.The waveguide 22 includes a projection 221a. The projection 221a protrudes toward the opening 24a from a part of a portion of the narrow wall 221 which portion is opposite the opening 24a. The projection 221a protrudes in a direction parallel to a positive x-axis direction. Similarly, the waveguide 23 includes a projection 231a. The projection 231a protrudes toward the opening 24a from a part of a portion of the narrow wall 231 which portion is opposite the opening 24a. The projection 231a protrudes in a direction parallel to a negative x-axis direction.The waveguide 22 includes a projection 24b and a projection 24c which are formed in a symmetric manner with respect to the opening 24a. The projection 24b is provided at a position on the narrow wall 24 which position is more toward the port 211 than is the opening 24a. The projection 24c is provided at a position on the narrow wall 24 which position is more toward the port 214 than is the opening 24a. The projections 24b and 24c form a pair of projections, each of which protrudes from the narrow wall 24 and toward the narrow wall 221. The waveguide 23 includes a projection 24d and a projection 24e which are formed in a symmetric manner with respect to the opening 24a. The projection 24d is provided at a position on the narrow wall 24 which position is more toward the port 212 than is the opening 24a. The projection 24e is provided at a position on the narrow wall 24 which position is more toward the port 213 than is the opening 24a. The projections 24d and 24e form a pair of projections, each of which protrudes from the narrow wall 24 and toward the narrow wall 231.By being configured to include the projections 221a and 231a, the pair of projections 24b and 24c, and the pair of projections 24d and 24e, the directional coupler section 21 is capable of reducing return loss in the operation band.The configuration of the directional coupler section 21 is not limited to that illustrated in Fig. 4. Specifically, any directional coupler section can be used as the directional coupler section 21, provided that the directional coupler section is produced using a post-wall waveguide technique.(Directional coupler section 31)The directional coupler section 31 is configured identically to the directional coupler section 21. Therefore, the following description will only discuss the relationship between the directional coupler section 31 and the directional coupler section 21, and the details of the directional coupler section 31 are omitted.The directional coupler section 31 includes a waveguide 32, which is a first rectangular waveguide, and a waveguide 33, which is a second rectangular waveguide. The waveguides 32 and 33 of the directional coupler section 31 correspond to the waveguides 22 and 23 of the directional coupler section 21, respectively. That is, narrow walls 34, 321, and 331 of the directional coupler section 31 correspond to the narrow walls 24, 221, and 231 of the directional coupler section 21, respectively. An opening 34a in the narrow wall 34 corresponds to the opening 24a in the narrow wall 24. The directional coupler section 31 is a 3 dB directional coupler section, similarly to the directional coupler section 21.The directional coupler section 31 includes a port 311 which is a first port, a port 312 which is a second port, a port 313 which is a third port, and a port 314 which is a fourth port. The ports 311, 312, 313, and 314 correspond to the ports 211, 212, 213, and 214 of the directional coupler section 21, respectively. The port 311 is connected to the port 122 of the BPF 12, and the port 312 is connected to the port 132 of the BPF 13.The directional coupler section 31 has projections 321a and 331a which correspond to the projections 221a and 231a of the directional coupler section 21, respectively. The directional coupler section 31 also includes (i) a pair of projections 34b and 34c which correspond to the pair of projections 24b and 24c of the directional coupler section 21, respectively, and (ii) a pair of projections 34d and 34e which correspond to the pair of projections 24d and 24e of the directional coupler section 21, respectively.(BPF 41)The BPF 41 is a band-pass filter whose passband is a second frequency band. The BPF 12 and the BPF 13 are designed to have a passband that is the first frequency band, whereas the BPF 41 is designed to have a passband that is the second frequency band. Except for the difference in passband, the BPF 41 is configured similarly to the BPF 12 and BPF 13. Therefore, the following description will only discuss the relationship between the BPF 41 and the BPF 13, and the details of the BPF 41 are omitted.The BPF 41 is a kind of waveguide (rectangular waveguide), four of whose faces are respectively constituted by the conductor layers 3 and 4 (which constitute a pair of wide walls) and narrow walls 42 and 413 (which are narrow walls). The narrow wall 42 is provided continuously with the narrow wall 24 of the directional coupler section 21 and forms a part of a narrow wall of the waveguide 23 of the directional coupler section 21. In other words, the waveguide 23 and the BPF 41 share the narrow wall 42.The BPF 41 is formed by six faces, two of which (opposite end faces of the BPF 41, i.e., the faces other than those constituted by the conductor layers 3 and 4 and the narrow walls 42 and 413) respectively serve as a port 411, which is a first port, and a port 412, which is a second port. The port 411 is coupled to the port 213 of the directional coupler section 21.The narrow walls 42 and 413 of the BPF 41 correspond to the narrow walls 14 and 133 of the BPF 13, respectively. The first port 411, the second port 412, and resonators 414 to 418 of the BPF 41 correspond to the first port 131, the second port 132, and the resonators 134 to 138 of the BPF 13, respectively.As illustrated in Fig. 4, six partition walls 41a, 41b, 41c, 41d, 41e, and 41f are provided inside the BPF 41. Thus, the BPF 41 is divided into seven compartments by the partition walls 41a, 41b, 41c, 41d, 41e, and 41f. The partition walls 41a, 41b, 41c, 41d, 41e, and 41f of the BPF 41 correspond to the partition walls 13a, 13b, 13c, 13d, 13e, and 13f of the BPF 13, respectively.The partition walls 41a, 41b, 41c, 41d, 41e, and 41f have openings 41aa, 41ba, 41ca, 41da, 41ea, and 41fa, respectively.The passband of the BPF 41 may be selected appropriately depending on the operation bands of a transmitter and a receiver connected to the diplexer 1. For example, in a case where, as illustrated in (a) of Fig. 2, the antenna 101 is connected to the first port P1, the Rx 102 is connected to the second port P2, and the Tx 103 is connected to the third port P3, the BPF 41 can be configured so as to allow passage of high frequency signals falling within the operation band of the Rx 102 and reflect high frequency signals falling within the operation band of the Tx 103.(Converter section)The diplexer 1 further includes a converter section 50A coupled to the first port P1 (see Fig. 5), a converter section 50B coupled to the second port P2 (see Fig. 5), a converter section coupled to the third port P3, and a terminal section 70 coupled to the fourth port P4 (see Fig. 6). The converter section 50A and converter section 50B correspond to the \"first converter section\" and \"second converter section\" recited in the claims, respectively. The converter section coupled to the third port P3 corresponds to the \"third converter section\" recited in the claims. The terminal section 70 corresponds to the \"fourth converter section\" recited in the claims. The converter section 50B and the converter section coupled to the third port P3 are both configured identically to the converter section 50A. As such, the following description will discuss the converter section 50A and the terminal section 70.(Converter section 50A)As illustrated in Fig. 5, the converter section 50A includes a port 501A, which is a first port, and a port 502A, which is a second port. The port 501A is coupled to the fourth port 214 of the directional coupler section 21.The converter section 50A includes a waveguide (rectangular waveguide), five of whose faces are respectively constituted by the conductor layers 3 and 4 (which constitute a pair of wide walls), narrow walls 53 and 511 (which are a pair of narrow walls), and a short wall 54A. The short wall 54A is one of the post walls constituting the narrow walls of the converter section 50A, but is referred to as a short wall for distinction from the pair of narrow walls 53 and 511 opposite from each other. The short wall 54A is a narrow wall opposite from the port 501A. This waveguide is a post-wall waveguide. As with the narrow walls 53 and 511, the short wall 54A is a post wall constituted by conductor posts.The waveguide of the converter section 50A is formed by six faces, one of which (one of the opposite end faces of the converter section 50A, i.e., the face other than those constituted by the conductor layers 3 and 4, narrow walls 511 and 53, and short wall 54A) serves as the port 501A for electromagnetic connection between the converter section 50A and members outside the converter section 50A.As illustrated in (a) and (b) of Fig. 5, the converter section 50A includes the dielectric layer 5, a signal line 55A, a pad 56A, a blind via 57A, and electrodes 58A and 59A.The dielectric layer 5 is provided on a surface of the conductor layer 3, which is the first wide wall. The dielectric layer 5 is provided so as to cover the surface of the conductor layer 3. The dielectric layer 5 is a single dielectric layer that is shared by the converter section 50A and converter section 50B (described later). The dielectric layer 5 has an opening 5aA that overlaps the waveguide of the converter section 50A.The conductor layer 3, which is the first wide wall for the converter section 50A, has an opening 3aA that overlaps the opening 5aA. In Embodiment 2, the opening 3aA is formed such that the opening 3aA encompasses the opening 5aA within its range. The opening 3aA serves as an anti-pad. As has been described, the opening 5aA and the opening 3aA are each provided in a region that overlaps the waveguide of the converter section 50A.The signal line 55A is a long, narrow conductor disposed on a surface of the dielectric layer 5. A first end portion of the signal line lies in a region that surrounds the opening 5aA and that overlaps the opening 3aA. The signal line 55A and the conductor layer 3 form a microstrip line.The pad 56A is a circular conductor layer provided on the surface of the substrate 2 on which surface the conductor layer 3 is provided. The pad 56A is located inside the opening 3aA in the conductor layer 3 and insulated from the conductor layer 3.The substrate 2 has a non-through-hole extending inward from the surface on which the conductor layer 3 is provided. The blind via 57A is constituted by a tube-shaped conductor film disposed on the inner wall of the non-through-hole. The blind via 57A is connected to a first end portion of the signal line 55A via the pad 56A so that the blind via 57A and the signal line 55A are in electrical communication with each other. In other words, the blind via 57A is electrically connected to the first end portion of the signal line 55A and is formed within the substrate 2.The electrodes 58A and 59A are disposed on the surface of the dielectric layer 5. The electrodes 58A and 59A are located near a second end portion of the signal line 55A such that the second end portion of the signal line 55A lies between the electrodes 58A and 59A.The dielectric layer 5 has through-holes in a region that overlaps the electrode 58. The through-holes are filled with a conductor to serve as vias 581A. The vias 581A achieve short circuiting between the electrode 58A and conductor layer 3.Vias 591A, which are configured similarly to the vias 581A, achieve short circuiting between the electrode 59A and the conductor layer 3.The second end portion of the signal line 55A and the electrodes 58A and 59A, which are arranged as described above, form the port 502A of the converter section 50A. The converter section 50A is capable of converting the mode of a high frequency signal coupled to the port 501A (high frequency signal having propagated through the waveguide 22) into the mode of a high frequency signal that is to propagate through the signal line 55A and the conductor layer 3, which constitute the microstrip line.As illustrated in (a) of Fig. 5, the port 502A is constituted by: the signal line 55A, which is a constituent of the microstrip line; and the electrodes 58A and 59A, which are grounded and between which the second end portion of the signal line 55A is located. Therefore, a transmitter circuit that transmits high frequency signals, a receiver circuit that receives high frequency signals, or an antenna circuit that transmits and/or receives high frequency signals can be easily connected to the port 502A. It is preferable that the distance between the second end portion of the signal line 55A and the electrode 58A and the distance between the second end portion of the signal line 55A and the electrode 59A are selected so that the electrodes match the shape of a terminal of the transmitter circuit, receiver circuit, or antenna circuit connected to the port 502A.(Converter section 50B)The converter section 50B is configured in a similar manner to the foregoing converter section 50A. Therefore, the following description will only discuss the relationship between the converter section 50B and the converter section 50A, and the details of the converter section 50B are omitted.As illustrated in (a) of Fig. 5, the converter section 50B includes a port 501B and a port 502B. The port 501B and the port 502B of the converter section 50B correspond to the port 501A and the port 502A of the converter section 50A, respectively. The port 501B is connected to the port 412 of the BPF 41.The converter section 50B includes a waveguide (rectangular waveguide), five of whose faces are respectively constituted by the conductor layers 3 and 4 (which constitute a pair of wide walls), narrow walls 53 and 521 (which are a pair of narrow walls), and a short wall 54B. The short wall 54B is one of the post walls constituting the narrow walls of the converter section 50B, but is referred to as a short wall for distinction from the pair of narrow walls 53 and 521 opposite from each other. The short wall 54B is a narrow wall opposite from the port 501B. This waveguide is a post-wall waveguide. As with the narrow walls 53 and 521, the short wall 54B is a post wall constituted by conductor posts.The converter section 50B includes constituents corresponding to the signal line 55A, the pad 56A, the blind via 57A, and the electrodes 58A and 59A of the converter section 50A. The port 502B is constituted by: a second end portion of a signal line corresponding to the signal line 55A of the converter section 50A; and two electrodes corresponding to the electrodes 58A and 59A of the converter section 50A.A transmitter circuit, a receiver circuit, or an antenna circuit can be connected to the port 502B, as with the port 502A.(Terminal section 70)The terminal section 70 is a terminated converter section. The terminal section 70 further includes a configuration that reduces reflection.As illustrated in (a) of Fig. 6, the terminal section 70 includes a port 701 and a port 702. The ports 701 and 702 of the terminal section 70 correspond to the ports 501A and 502A of the converter section 50A, respectively.The terminal section 70 includes a waveguide (rectangular waveguide), five of whose faces are respectively constituted by the conductor layers 3 and 4 (which constitute a pair of wide walls), narrow walls 711 and 73 (which are a pair of narrow walls), and a short wall 74.The terminal section 70 includes a signal line 75, a pad 76, a blind via 77, and an electrode 79. The signal line 75, the pad 76, the blind via 77, and the electrode 79 correspond to the signal line 55A, the pad 56A, the blind via 57A, and the electrodes 58A and 59A of the converter section 50A, respectively. Because the pad 76 and the blind via 77 correspond to the pad 56A and the blind via 57A, respectively, and descriptions therefor are omitted here.The dielectric layer 5 has an opening 5aD corresponding to the opening 5aA illustrated in Fig. 5. The conductor layer 3 has an opening 3aD corresponding to the opening 3aA illustrated in Fig. 5.The signal line 75 includes: a wide portion 751 constituting a first end portion of the signal line 75; a narrow portion 752 constituting an intermediate portion of the signal line 75; and a conductor pad 755 constituting a second end portion of the signal line 75.The wide portion 751 is constituted by: a circular head portion; and a neck portion whose width is smaller than the diameter of the head portion. The narrow portion 752 is a long, narrow conductor connected to the wide portion 751, and is smaller in width than the neck portion of the wide portion 751. The conductor pad 755 is a rectangular piece of conductor.The electrode 79 is a rectangular piece of conductor that is larger in area than each of the electrodes 58A and 59A. The electrode 79 is configured in this manner in order to further reduce the resistance and parasitic inductance component that would occur between the electrode 79 and the conductor layer 3 and to further stabilize the potential (ground potential) of the electrode 79. The dielectric layer 5 has through-holes in a region overlapping the electrode 79. The through-holes are filled with a conductor to serve as vias 781i. The vias 781i constitute a via group 781, which achieves short circuiting between the electrode 79 and the conductor layer 3.The terminal section 70 further includes a resistor 760 for electrical communication between the conductor pad 755 and the electrode 79. The opposite ends of the resistor 760 are connected to the conductor pad 755 and the electrode 79, respectively, with a connection member (e.g., solder). Thus, the terminal section 70 is a terminated converter section. A chip resistor may be suitably used as the resistor 760.The narrow portion 752 has an open stub 753 and a meander portion 754, each of which is provided somewhere between the opposite ends of the narrow portion 752. The open stub 753 is a long narrow conductor. A first end portion of the open stub 753 is connected somewhere between the opposite ends of the narrow portion 752, and a second end portion of the open stub 753 is open. The meander portion 754 is a long, narrow conductor that is equal in width to the narrow portion 752, and is meandered so that the path length of the narrow portion 752 increases.The terminal section 70 is configured such that, by adjusting the lengths of the open stub 753 and the meander portion, it is possible to control the input impedance (in a direction from the waveguide to the terminal section, i.e., in the direction from the port 701 toward the port 702) to a desired value. In other words, the terminal section 70 configured as above can further reduce reflection. Thus, the terminal section 70 is capable of restricting a high frequency signal, coupled from the fourth port 314 of the directional coupler section 31, from being reflected at the terminal section 70 and becoming a reflected signal returning to the inside of the diplexer 1.[Embodiment 3]With reference to Fig. 7, the following description will discuss a diplexer in accordance with Embodiment 3 of the present invention. A diplexer 1A in accordance with Embodiment 3 is a second example configuration of the diplexer 1 in accordance with Embodiment 1. The diplexer 1A of Embodiment 3 utilizes metal waveguide tubes. The diplexer 1A includes a filter pair 11A, a directional coupler section 21A, a directional coupler section 31A, and a BPF 41A.(a), (b), and (c) of Fig. 7 are perspective views illustrating the directional coupler section 21A, the filter pair 11A, and the BPF 41A of the diplexer 1A, respectively. The directional coupler section 31A is configured identically to the directional coupler section 21A, and is therefore not illustrated.The diplexer 1 illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4 involved the use a post-wall waveguide technique to realize the diplexer 1 in accordance with Embodiment 1. However, a diplexer in accordance with an aspect of the present invention may be realized with use of a metal waveguide tube technique, as is done in the diplexer 1A illustrated in Fig. 7.The various members of the diplexer 1A illustrated in Fig. 7 correspond to the various members of the diplexer 1 illustrated in Fig. 4. Corresponding members of the diplexer 1A and the diplexer 1 have reference symbols which are similar, with an additional \"A\" appended to the end of reference symbols for the diplexer 1A.[Example 1]A diplexer 1 of Example 1 was prepared as an example of the diplexer 1 illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4.In the diplexer 1 of Example 1, the passband of the BPF 12 and BPF 13 is a 71-76 GHz band (center frequency: 73.5 GHz), and the passband of the BPF 41 is an 81-86 GHz band (center frequency: 83.5 GHz). (a) of Fig. 8 illustrates frequency dependence of an S parameter (derived via simulation) of the diplexer 1 of Example 1, as observed in a case where the Rx 102 is connected to the port P2 and the Tx 103 is connected to the port P3 as illustrated in (a) of Fig. 2. (b) of Fig. 8 illustrates frequency dependence of the S parameter (derived via simulation) of the diplexer 1 of Example 1, as observed in a case where the Tx 103 is connected to the port P2 and the Rx 102 is connected to the port P3 as illustrated in (b) of Fig. 2.In the graph of (a) of Fig. 8, S(1, 2) indicates transmission characteristics from port P1 to port P2 (i.e., transmission characteristics from the antenna 101 to the Rx 102), and S(2, 3) indicates transmission characteristics from the port P2 to the port P3 (i.e., transmission characteristics from the Rx 102 to the Tx 103). In a case where the connection example illustrated in (a) of Fig. 2 is employed, the frequency band of incoming waves received by the Rx 102 is an 81-86 GHz band, and the frequency band of outgoing waves transmitted by the Tx 103 is a 71-76 GHz band.In a case where the connection example illustrated in (a) of Fig. 2 is employed, in the 81-86 GHz band, it is desirable for the diplexer 1 to have properties such that S(1, 2) is large (good transmission characteristics) and S(2, 3) is small (good isolation characteristics).(a) of Fig. 8 indicates that in the 81-86 GHz band, the value of S(2, 3) is -83 dB at the maximum value. It was thus found that the diplexer 1 of Example 1 had favorable isolation characteristics between the port P2 and the port P3.In the graph of (b) of Fig. 8, S(1, 3) indicates transmission characteristics from port P1 to port P3 (i.e., transmission characteristics from the antenna 101 to the Rx 102), and S(2, 3) indicates transmission characteristics from the port P2 to the port P3 (i.e., transmission characteristics from the Rx 102 to the Tx 103). In a case where the connection example illustrated in (b) of Fig. 2 is employed, the frequency band of incoming waves received by the Rx 102 is a 71-76 GHz band, and the frequency band of outgoing waves transmitted by the Tx 103 is an 81-86 GHz band.(b) of Fig. 8 indicates that in the 71-76 GHz band, the value of S(2, 3) is -52 dB at the maximum value. It was thus found that the diplexer 1 of Example 1 had favorable isolation characteristics between the port P2 and the port P3.Thus, it was found that the diplexer 1 of Example 1 exhibits favorable isolation characteristics both when the connection example illustrated in (a) of Fig. 2 is employed and when the connection example illustrated in (b) of Fig. 2 is employed. Note that a comparison between the connection examples of (a) of Fig. 2 and (b) of Fig. 2 (i.e., a comparison between (a) and (b) of Fig. 8) shows that the connection example of (a) of Fig. 2 exhibits a more favorable isolation characteristic. In other words, the Rx 102 is more preferably connected to the port P2 than to the port P3, and the Tx 103 is more preferably connected to the port P3 than to the port P2.Used as a diplexer of Comparative Example 1 was a diplexer similar to the diplexer 1 of Example 1, except that the BPF 41 was omitted. (a) of Fig. 10 illustrates frequency dependence of the S parameter (derived via simulation) of the diplexer of Comparative Example 1, as observed in a case where the Tx 103 is connected to the port P2 and the Rx 102 is connected to the port P3 as illustrated in (b) of Fig. 2.(a) of Fig. 10 indicates that in the 71-76 GHz band, the value of S(2, 3) is worsened to -20 dB at the maximum value. Thus, from a comparison of the graphs of (b) of Fig. 8 and (a) of Fig. 10, it can be seen that when employing the connection example of (b) of Fig. 2, inclusion of the BPF 41 in the diplexer 1 makes it possible to improve isolation characteristics between the port P2 and the port P3.In a case where the connection example of (a) of Fig. 2 was employed in the diplexer of Comparative Example 1, it was similarly found that the value of S(2, 3) worsened to -20 dB at the maximum value. Thus, it was found that when employing the connection example of (a) of Fig. 2 as well, inclusion of the BPF 41 in the diplexer 1 improves isolation characteristics between the port P2 and the port P3.[Example 2]A diplexer 1 of Example 2 was prepared as an example of the diplexer 1 illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4.In the diplexer 1 of Example 2, the passband of the BPF 12 and BPF 13 is an 81-86 GHz band (center frequency: 83.5 GHz), and the passband of the BPF 41 is a 71-76 GHz band (center frequency: 73.5 GHz). (a) of Fig. 9 illustrates frequency dependence of an S parameter (derived via simulation) of the diplexer 1 of Example 2, as observed in a case where the Rx 102 is connected to the port P2 and the Tx 103 is connected to the port P3 as illustrated in (a) of Fig. 2. (b) of Fig. 9 illustrates frequency dependence of the S parameter (derived via simulation) of the diplexer 1 of Example 2, as observed in a case where the Tx 103 is connected to the port P2 and the Rx 102 is connected to the port P3 as illustrated in (b) of Fig. 2.(a) of Fig. 9 indicates that in the 71-76 GHz band, the value of S(2, 3) is -92 dB at the maximum value. (b) of Fig. 9 indicates that in the 81-86 GHz band, the value of S(2, 3) is -51 dB at the maximum value. Thus, it was found that the diplexer 1 of Example 2 exhibits favorable isolation characteristics between the port P2 and the port P3 both when the connection example illustrated in (a) of Fig. 2 is employed and when the connection example illustrated in (b) of Fig. 2 is employed.Note that a comparison between the connection examples of (a) of Fig. 2 and (b) of Fig. 2 (i.e., a comparison between (a) and (b) of Fig. 9) shows that the connection example of (a) of Fig. 2 exhibits a more favorable isolation characteristic. In other words, in Example 2 as well, the Rx 102 is more preferably connected to the port P2 than to the port P3, and the Tx 103 is more preferably connected to the port P3 than to the port P2.Used as a diplexer of Comparative Example 2 was a diplexer similar to the diplexer of Example 2, except that the BPF 41 was omitted. (b) of Fig. 10 illustrates frequency dependence of the S parameter (derived via simulation) of the diplexer of Comparative Example 2, as observed in a case where the Tx 103 is connected to the port P2 and the Rx 102 is connected to the port P3 as illustrated in (b) of Fig. 2. (b) of Fig. 10 indicates that in the 81-86 GHz band, the value of S(2, 3) is worsened to -15 dB at the maximum value. Thus, from a comparison of the graphs of (b) of Fig. 9 and (b) of Fig. 10, it can be seen that when employing the connection example of (b) of Fig. 2, inclusion of the BPF 41 in the diplexer 1 makes it possible to improve isolation characteristics between the port P2 and the port P3.In a case where the connection example of (a) of Fig. 2 was employed in the diplexer of Comparative Example 2, it was similarly found that the value of S(2, 3) worsened to -15 dB at the maximum value. Thus, it was found that when employing the connection example of (a) of Fig. 2 as well, inclusion of the BPF 41 in the diplexer 1 improves isolation characteristics between the port P2 and the port P3.Aspects of the present invention can also be expressed as follows.A diplexer (1, 1A) in accordance with an aspect of the present invention includes: a filter pair (11, 11A) constituted by (i) a first filter (12, 12A) including a first port (121, 121A) and a second port (122, 122A) and (ii) a second filter (13, 13A) including a first port (131, 131A) and a second port (132, 132A), the first filter (12, 12A) and the second filter (13, 13A) each having a passband that is a first frequency band, the first filter (12, 12A) and the second filter (13, 13A) being arranged next to each other; a first directional coupler section (21, 21A) including a first port (211, 211A) and a second port (212, 212A) arranged next to each other and a third port (213, 213A) and a fourth port (214, 214A) arranged next to each other, the first port (211, 211A) of the first directional coupler section (21, 21A) being connected to the first port (121, 121A) of the first filter (12, 12A), the second port (212, 212A) of the first directional coupler section (21, 21A) being connected to the first port (131, 131A) of the second filter (13, 13A); a second directional coupler section (31, 31A) including a first port (311, 311A) and a second port (312, 312A) arranged next to each other and a third port (313, 313A) and a fourth port (314, 314A) arranged next to each other, the first port (311, 311A) of the second directional coupler section (31, 31A) being connected to the second port (122, 122A) of the first filter (12, 12A), the second port (312, 312A) of the second directional coupler section (31, 31A) being connected to the second port (132, 132A) of the second filter (13, 13A); and a third filter (41, 41A) having a passband that is a second frequency band differing from the first frequency band, the third filter (41, 41A) including a first port (411, 411A) and a second port (412, 412A), the first port (411, 411A) of the third filter (41, 41A) being connected to the third port (213, 213A) of the first directional coupler section (21, 21A).The diplexer configured as above includes four ports, that is, (1) the fourth port of the first directional coupler section, (2) the second port of the third filter, (3) the third port of the second directional coupler section, and (4) the fourth port of the second directional coupler section. Out of these four ports, one port (for example, the fourth port of the first directional coupler section) can be used as an antenna port, another port (for example, the second port of the third filter) can be used as a Tx port or Rx port, and yet another port (for example, the third port of the second directional coupler section) can be used as the Rx port or the Tx port. In a case where the above \"another port\" is used as a Tx port, the above \"yet another port\" can be used as a Rx port; in a case where the above \"another port\" is used as an Rx port, the above \"yet another port\" can be used as a Tx port.Because the diplexer includes the third filter, the diplexer is able to achieve greater isolation between (i) the second port of the third filter and (ii) the third and fourth ports of the second directional coupler section, as compared to a conventional diplexer. In other words, the diplexer makes it possible to achieve greater isolation between a port which can be used as a Tx port and a port which can be used as an Rx port.In an aspect of the present invention, the diplexer (1, 1A) is preferably configured such that: the fourth port (214, 214A) of the first directional coupler section (21, 21A) is an antenna port for connection with an antenna (101); the second port (412, 412A) of the third filter (41, 41A) is an Rx port for connection with a receiver circuit (102); and the third port (313, 313A) of the second directional coupler section (31, 31A) is a Tx port for connection with a transmitter circuit (103).In the diplexer configured as above, the fourth port of the first directional coupler section can be used as an antenna port, the second port of the third filter can be used as an Rx port, and the third port of the second directional coupler section can be used as a Tx port. Incoming waves inputted into the fourth port of the first directional coupler section (the antenna port) are outputted from the second port of the third filter (Rx port). Outgoing waves inputted into the diplexer via the third port of the second directional coupler section (Tx port) are outputted from the fourth port of the first directional coupler section (antenna port). The diplexer configured in this manner makes it possible to further improve isolation between the Rx port and the Tx port.In an aspect of the present invention, the diplexer (1, 1A) is preferably configured such that: the first filter (12, 12A) includes a first resonator (124, 124A) and a second resonator (128, 128A) which are coupled to each other either directly or via one or more other resonators (125 to 127, 125A to 127A); the second filter (13, 13A) includes a first resonator (134, 134A) and a second resonator (138, 138A) which are coupled to each other either directly or via one or more other resonators (135 to 137, 135A to 137A); the third filter (41, 41A) includes a first resonator (414, 414A) and a second resonator (418, 418A) which are coupled to each other either directly or via one or more other resonators (415 to 417, 415A to 417A); the first directional coupler section (21, 21A) includes a first rectangular waveguide (22, 22A) and a second rectangular waveguide (23, 23A) which share a first narrow wall (24, 24A) having an opening (24a, 24aA), the first and second rectangular waveguides (22, 22A, 23, 23A) of the first directional coupler section (21, 21A) each having a respective second narrow wall (221, 231, 221A, 231A) facing the first narrow wall (24, 24A) of the first directional coupler section (21, 21A); the second directional coupler section (31, 31A) includes a first rectangular waveguide (32) and a second rectangular waveguide (33) which share a first narrow wall (34) having an opening (34a), the first and second rectangular waveguides (32, 33) of the second directional coupler section (31, 31A) each having a respective second narrow wall (321, 331) facing the first narrow wall (34) of the second directional coupler section (31, 31A); and respective waveguides of (i) the first and second filters of the filter pair (11, 11A), (ii) the third filter (41, 41A), (iii) the first directional coupler section (21, 21A), and (iv) the second directional coupler section (31, 31A) are post-wall waveguides that have a first wide wall (3), a second wide wall (4), and narrow walls, the first wide wall (3) and the second wide (4) wall being a pair of conductor layers (3, 4) provided on opposite sides of a single dielectric substrate (2), each of the narrow walls being a post wall constituted by conductor posts passing through the single dielectric substrate (2).In the diplexer configured as described above, the filter pair, the first directional coupler section, the second directional coupler section, and the third filter are produced with use of a single dielectric substrate and a pair of conductor layers provided on the opposite sides of the dielectric substrate. That is, the diplexer is configured such that the filter pair, the first directional coupler section, the second directional coupler section, and the third filter are integrated into a single device with use of a post-wall waveguide technique.As such, the diplexer is smaller and more lightweight than a diplexer constituted by metal waveguide tubes.In an aspect of the present invention, the diplexer (1, 1A) is preferably configured to further include: a first converter section (50A) coupled to the fourth port (214, 214a) of the first directional coupler section (21, 21A); a second converter section (50B) coupled to the second port (412, 412A) of the third filter (41, 41A); a third converter section coupled to the third port (313, 313A) of the second directional coupler section (31, 31A); and a fourth converter section (70) coupled to the fourth port (314, 314A) of the second directional coupler section (31, 31A), wherein: each of the first to fourth converter sections (50A, 50B, 70) includes a respective waveguide which is a post-wall waveguide that has (i) a first wide wall (3) and a second wide wall (4) which are the pair of conductor layers (3, 4) and (ii) narrow walls which are each a post wall constituted by conductor posts passing through the single dielectric substrate (2); each of the first to fourth converter sections (50A, 50B, 70) has an opening (3aA, 3aD) in the first wide wall (3) of that converter section (50A, 50B, 70); and each of the first to fourth converter sections (50A, 50B, 70) further includes: a dielectric layer (5) disposed on a surface of the first wide wall (3) of that converter section (50A, 50B, 70), the dielectric layer (5) having an opening (5aA, 5aD) that overlaps the opening (3aA, 3aD) in the first wide wall (3) of that converter section (50A, 50B, 70); a signal line (55A, 75) disposed on a surface of the dielectric layer (5) of that converter section (50A, 50B, 70), a first end portion of the signal line (55A, 75) overlapping the opening (3aA, 3aD) in the first wide wall (3) and the opening (5aA, 5aD) in the dielectric layer (5) of that converter section (50A, 50B, 70); an electrode (58A, 59A, 79) disposed on the surface of the dielectric layer (5) of that converter section (50A, 50B, 70), the electrode (58A, 59A, 79) being in electrical communication with the first wide wall (3) of that converter section (50A, 50B, 70) via a via (581A, 591A, 781i) in the dielectric layer (5) of that converter section (50A, 50B, 70), and a blind via (57A, 77) provided in the dielectric substrate (5) of that converter section (50A, 50B, 70), the blind via (57A, 77) being in electrical communication with the first end portion of the signal line (55A, 75) of that converter section (50A, 50B, 70).According to the above configuration, the respective signal lines of the first to fourth converter sections, together with the first wide wall, constitute respective microstrip lines. The microstrip line and the waveguide of each converter section are electromagnetically coupled together via the blind via. As such, each converter section is capable of converting the mode of a high frequency signal, which has propagated through the waveguide, into the mode of a high frequency signal that is to propagate through the microstrip line.Furthermore, the dielectric layer of each converter section has, on its surface, the signal line and the electrode that is in electrical communication with the first wide wall. Therefore, the diplexer in accordance with an aspect of the present invention enables easier mounting of any of various circuits (e.g., transmitter circuit, receiver circuit, and antenna) to the converter sections, as compared to conventional diplexers.In an embodiment of the present invention, the diplexer (1, 1A) is preferably configured such that the fourth converter section (70) further includes a resistor (760), via which electrical communication is achieved between (i) a second end portion of the signal line (75) of the fourth converter section (70) and (ii) the electrode (79) of the fourth converter section (70).With the above configuration, use of the resistor makes it possible to easily achieve electrical communication between (i) the second end portion of the signal line of the fourth converter section and (ii) the electrode of the fourth converter section. That is, it is possible to easily terminate the fourth converter section. The terminated converter section reduces reflection to a greater extent than non-terminated converter sections (converter sections in which the second end portion of the signal line is open). As such, the terminated fourth converter section is capable of restricting a high frequency signal, inputted from one of the first to third converter sections, from being reflected at the fourth converter section and returning to the inside of the diplexer as a reflected signal.In an embodiment of the present invention, the diplexer (1A) is preferably configured such that: the first filter (12A) includes a first resonator (124A) and a second resonator (128A) which are coupled to each other either directly or via one or more other resonators (125A to 127A); the second filter (13A) includes a first resonator (134A) and a second resonator (138A) which are coupled to each other either directly or via one or more other resonators (135A to 137A); the third filter (41A) includes a first resonator (414A) and a second resonator (418A) which are coupled to each other either directly or via one or more other resonators (415A to 417A); the first directional coupler section (21A) includes a first rectangular waveguide (22A) and a second rectangular waveguide (23A) which share a first narrow wall (24A) having an opening (24aA), the first and second rectangular waveguides (22A, 23A) of the first directional coupler section (21A) each having a respective second narrow wall (221A, 231A) facing the first narrow wall (24A) of the first directional coupler section (21A); the second directional coupler section (31A) includes a first rectangular waveguide (22A) and a second rectangular waveguide (23A) which share a first narrow wall (24A) having an opening (24aA), the first and second rectangular waveguides (22A, 23A) of the second directional coupler section (31A) each having a respective second narrow wall (221A, 231A) facing the first narrow wall (24A) of the second directional coupler section (31A); and respective waveguides of (i) the first and second filters of the filter pair (11A), (ii) the third filter (41A), (iii) the first directional coupler section (21A), and (iv) the second directional coupler section (31A) are constituted by metal waveguide tubes.The above configuration can be suitably used in a case where metal waveguide tubes are used for (i) a port of an antenna to be connected with an antenna port, a port of a transmitter circuit to be connected with a Tx port, and a port of a receiver circuit to be connected with an Rx port. Using metal waveguide tubes for the antenna port, the Tx port, and the Rx port makes it possible to reduce return loss when the diplexer is connected to an antenna, a transmitter circuit, and a receiver circuit whose ports are constituted by metal waveguide tubes.The present invention is not limited to the embodiments, but can be altered by a skilled person in the art within the scope of the claims. The present invention also encompasses, in its technical scope, any embodiment derived by combining technical means disclosed in differing embodiments.Reference Signs List1 Diplexer2 Substrate (dielectric substrate)3 Conductor layer (constitutes a pair of conductor layers with the conductor layer 4)4 Conductor layer (constitutes a pair of conductor layers with the conductor layer 3)5 Dielectric layer11, 11A Filter pair12 BPF (first filter)12a to 12f Partition wall12aa to 12fa Opening121 First port122 Second port123 Narrow wall124 to 128 Resonator13 BPF (second filter)13a to 13f Partition wall13aa to 13fa Opening131 First port132 Second port133 Narrow wall134 to 138 Resonator14 Narrow wall21, 21A Directional coupler section (first directional coupler section)31 Directional coupler section (second directional coupler section)211, 311 First port212, 312 Second port213, 313 Third port214, 314 Fourth port22, 22A, 32 Waveguide (first rectangular waveguide)221, 321 Narrow wall (second narrow wall)221a, 321a Projection23, 23A, 33 Waveguide (second rectangular waveguide)231, 331 Narrow wall (second narrow wall)231a, 331a Projection24, 24A, 34 Narrow wall (first narrow wall)24a, 34a Opening24b to 24e, 34b to 34e Projection41, 41A BPF (third filter)41a to 41f Partition wall41aa to 41fa Opening411 First port412 Second port413 Narrow wall414 to 418 Resonator50A Converter section50B Converter section55A Signal line57A Blind via58A, 59A, 79 Electrode70 Terminal section (terminated converter section)75 Signal line77 Blind via760 Resistor101 Antenna102 Rx (receiver circuit)103 Tx (transmitter circuit)]   \n",

program of the barker channel corresponding to the current channel in the window of the EPG user interface.In some embodiments, the EPG user interface is displayed according to event information in the barker channel corresponding to the current channel.In some embodiments, the processor is further configured to execute the computer instructions to enable the display device to perform:receiving an input instruction for exiting from the EPG user interface; anddisplaying a broadcast program of the current channel on the display screen, in response to the input instruction for exiting from the EPG user interface.In some embodiments, the displaying the EPG user interface, and displaying the broadcast program of the current channel in the window of the EPG user interface, includes:reading all event information at the same frequency point and other event information except for the event information at the same frequency point from the memory;generating an EPG user interface through an EPG generator according to the event information read from the memory; anddisplaying the EPG user interface processed through a video display processor on a broadcast program image of the current channel displayed on the display screen so as to ensure that the EPG user interface is displayed fully and , a system controller does not need to call a switch interface of the display device to switch the channel to the barker channel corresponding to the current channel.In some embodiments, the displaying an EPG user interface and displaying the broadcast program of the barker channel corresponding to the current channel in the window of the EPG user interface includes:calling a switch interface of the display device to switch the channel to the barker channel corresponding to the current channel;obtaining event information in the current channel;generating the EPG user interface through an EPG generator according to the event information at the frequency point of the current channel and other event information except for the event information at the frequency point of the current channel;displaying the EPG user interface processed through a video display processor on a broadcast program image of the current channel on the display screen so as to ensure that the EPG user interface is displayed fully and meanwhile the broadcast program of the barker channel corresponding to the current channel is displayed in the window of the EPG user interface.In the above examples, during the broadcast program displaying process of the channel displayed on the display screen, when entering the EPG, whether the channel currently displayed has a corresponding barker channel is determined at first; when the current channel has a corresponding barker channel, then, whether the frequency points of the channel and the corresponding barker channel are consistent are further determined; finally, if the frequency points are consistent, the EPG user interface is displayed, and a broadcast program of the current channel is displayed in a window of the EPG user interface.In this way, on the one hand, since the frequency point of the current channel is the same as that of the corresponding barker channel, broadcast program information at the frequency point where the current channel belongs is already obtained when entering the current channel, thus, the EPG can be displayed completely without switching to the barker channel; and on the other hand, since the broadcast program of the current channel is still played after the user enters the EPG, the effects that the content of the broadcast program does not change after the user enters the EPG, and the short black screen phenomenon is avoided during entering and exiting of the EPG are ensured.Brief

Obviously, the described embodiments are only a part of the embodiments of the present disclosure, but not all of the embodiments. All other embodiments obtained by those ordinarily skilled in the art without making creative efforts based on the embodiments in the present disclosure fall within the protection scope of the present disclosure.In a scenario, when broadcast program information of channels needs to be obtained, since the broadcast program information of some channels is displayed on barker channels corresponding to the channels, a user must enter the barker channels to obtain the broadcast program information. Therefore, when a user enters an EPG, the user switches to the corresponding barker channels to obtain the corresponding broadcast program information on these channels at first, and then the EPG is displayed; when the user exits the EPG, the channel chose by the user before the user enters the EPG is restored. In this way, the broadcast program information of these channels can be obtained to display it on the EPG, but the channel switching action during entering and exiting of the EPG will cause bad user experience. For example, the content of a broadcast program played after the user enters the EPG has been changed; or obvious black screen phenomenon for a certain time (for example, about 2 seconds) is caused by the channel switching action when entering or exiting the EPGTherefore, embodiments of the present disclosure provide a method for displaying an EPG user interface and a device. The following description takes a smart TV as an example of a display device to discuss the embodiments of the present disclosure in detail.Fig.1 is a schematic diagram of a smart TV. As shown in Fig.1, the smart TV may include a tuner 101, a user interface 102, a system controller 103, a memory 104, an EPG generator 105, a video display processor 106, a display screen 107 and the like. The tuner 101 is configured to tune broadcast channels according to a user operation on the user interface 102 and control of the system controller 103; the memory 104 is configured for storing EPG information extracted from additional information contained in a digital broadcast signal or an analog broadcast signal received from the tuner 101; the EPG generator 105 may include an on screen display (OSD) generator and is configured for generating an EPG based on the EPG information stored in the memory 104; and the display screen 107 is used for displaying the EPG processed by the video display processor 106.Specifically, in the process of displaying a TV broadcast program on the display screen 107 of the smart TV, the tuner 101 receives a broadcast signal, and a decoder (not shown) extracts EPG information from the received broadcast signal and outputs the extracted EPG information to an internal bus; and thus, the system controller stores the EPG information output to the internal bus in the memory 104 for displaying the EPG user interface.When an EPG display request signal sent from a user through the user interface 102 (such as a remote control) is input to the system controller 103, for example, by pressing an EPG button on the remote control, that is, in response to the EPG display request sent from the user, the system controller 103 controls to read the EPG information from the memory 104, so that the EPG generator 105 can construct an EPG based on the read EPG information and EPG images generated by the OSD generator with pre-stored image data, and then the EPG user interface is displayed on the display screen 107 through the video display processor 106.The broadcast signal is called a TS signal, and a data portion, different from an audio/video portion, of the TS signal is reconstructed to form a program information table. The program information table includes broadcast program information such as a program association table (PAT), a program mapping table (PMT), a network information table (NIT) and an event information table (EIT). The EIT stores multiple events, namely the above-mentioned extracted EPG information, which may include start time and end time of a broadcast program, and multiple descriptor fields, such as a short event descriptor field identifying a program name of the broadcast program, an extended event descriptor field identifying lead roles, screenwriters, profile and other information of the broadcast program, and a component descriptor field identifying the program type of the broadcast program.For example: in some embodiments, display of the EPG user interface on the display screen is shown in Fig.2, an area 21 in the EPG user interface shows a broadcast program menu of five channels (DC a-DC e) playing between 3:00 PM and 5:00 PM, broadcast programs of each channel are displayed on a line according to the program play time: broadcast programs a0-a3 of a DC a channel, broadcast programs b0-b5 of a DC b channel, broadcast programs c0-c6 of a DC c channel, broadcast programs d0-d8 of a DC d channel, and broadcast programs e0-e7 of a DC e channel. An area 22 shows details of a selected broadcast program, such as the channel name, program name, play time, program type and content profile of the a2 broadcast program. An area 23 shows a broadcast program of the channel being watched before entering an EPG, for example, the broadcast program a1 which is being watched on the DC a channel at 3:50 pm.However, since the EPG information of some channels is on the corresponding barker channels, if a user wants to obtain the EPG information of these channels, the user has to enter the barker channels, otherwise the user cannot obtain the EPG information. Therefore, when the user presses an EPG button on a remote control, the smart TV first needs to switch to the corresponding barker channel to obtain the corresponding EPG information of the channel, and thus, when the EPG is displayed, the broadcast program of the barker channel can be played in the window of the area 23 in Fig.2; and when the user presses a back button on the remote control, the smart TV exits from the EPG and is redirected to the channel before entering the EPG In this way, the EPG information of these channels can be obtained to display the EPG, but the channel switching action when entering and exiting from the EPG will cause undesirable user experience to the user. For example, the content of the broadcast programs played before and after entering the EPG is inconsistent, or obvious nearly 2-second black screen is caused due to the slow channel switching action when entering and exiting from the EPGIn view of the above problem, as shown in Fig.3, an embodiment of the present disclosure provides a method for displaying an EPG user interface applied to a smart TV, wherein the method includes the following steps.31. Displaying a broadcast program of a current channel on a display screen.32. Receiving an input instruction for displaying the EPG user interface.33. Determining whether the current channel has a corresponding barker channel in response to the input instruction; if it is determined that the current channel has a corresponding barker channel, the method goes to 34; otherwise, the method goes to 35.34. Determining whether the current channel and the barker channel corresponding to the current channel are at a same frequency point; if it is determined that the current channel and the barker channel are at the same frequency point, the method goes to 35; otherwise, the method goes to 36.35. Displaying the EPG user interface, and displaying a broadcast program of the current channel in a window of the EPG user interface.While a user is watching the broadcast program of a channel, when a smart TV receives an EPG display request signal sent from the user through a remote control, a system controller first determines whether the current channel has a corresponding barker channel.Here, related information of the barker channel is recorded in the NIT of a program information table. For example, in the \"linkage_descriptor\" in the NIT shown in Fig.4, a descriptor field \"Transport_stream_id\" indicates the channel identifier corresponding to the barker channel is 0x44D (1101), while in the PMT table shown in Fig.4, the channel identifier corresponding to the barker channel is RTP1, that is, the RTP1 channel has a corresponding barker channel.Then, according to the above example process, after it is determined that the current channel has a corresponding barker channel, whether the current channel and the corresponding barker channel are at the same frequency point is further determined next. When it is determined that the current channel and the corresponding barker channel are at the same frequency point, since all event information at the frequency point (a frequency point may correspond to multiple channels) of the current channel has been obtained when entering the current channel play, that is, the event information of the current channel has already been obtained from the frequency point of the current channel, thus the system controller can directly read all event information at the frequency point in the memory, and other event information in the memory except for the event information at the frequency point, and cause an EPG generator to generate a EPG user interface, the EPG user interface after being processed by a video display processor is displayed on the broadcast program image of the current channel on the display screen, so as to ensure a full display of the EPG user interface; and meanwhile, the system controller does not need to call a switch interface of the display device (for example, a smart TV channel-switch interface) to switch the current channel to the corresponding barker channel, therefore, the broadcast program of the current channel will continue being played in the window of the area 23 in the EPG user interface to ensure that the content of the broadcast program remains unchanged after entering the EPG, and short black screen due to the low switching speed when entering the EPG is avoided.If it is determined that there is no barker channel corresponding to the current channel, that is, the event information of the current channel can be obtained from the corresponding frequency point, the system controller directly reads all event information at the frequency point of the current channel in the memory, and other EIT information in the memory except for all event information at the frequency point of the current channel, and cause the EPG generator to generate an EPG user interface, and the EPG user interface after being processed by the video display processor is displayed on the broadcast program image of the current channel on the display screen. Meanwhile, the window in the area 23 of the EPG user interface continues playing the broadcast program of the current channel.36. Displaying the EPG user interface, and displaying a broadcast program of a barker channel corresponding to the current channel in a window of the EPG user interface.When it is determined that the current channel has a corresponding barker channel, and the current channel and the corresponding barker channel do not belong to the same frequency point, since the event information of the current channel is obtained after entering the corresponding barker channel, the system controller calls the smart TV channel switch interface to switch the current channel to the corresponding barker channel, event information of the current channel is obtained, thus, the EPG generator is enabled to generate an EPG user interface based on the event information of the current channel and other event information in the memory, and the EPG user interface after being processed by the video display processor is displayed on the broadcast program image of the current channel on the display screen, so that a full display of the EPG user interface is ensured; and meanwhile, a broadcast program of the switched barker channel is played in the window in the area 23 of the EPG user interface.After receiving an input instruction for exiting from the EPG user interface, the broadcast program of the current channel is displayed on the display screen in response to the input instruction.After the smart TV receives the EPG exit request signal sent from the user through the remote control, the system controller controls the EPG user interface to exit and back to play the broadcast program of the current channel.In a specific implementation process, a first variable may be defined to record whether the TV needs to be switched to the barker channel when entering the EPG user interface, and is set to false by default, that is, the TV does not need to switch to the barker channel; a second variable may be defined to record the channel to be returned when exiting from the EPG user interface.In some examples, the broadcast program a1 of the DC a channel shown in Fig.2 is being played currently. When entering an EPG user interface, it is first determined whether the DC a channel has a corresponding barker channel. If there is such a corresponding barker channel, then it is further determined whether the DC a channel and the corresponding barker channel are at the same frequency point.If the DC a channel and the corresponding barker channel are at the same frequency point, then the first variable is kept as false, and the EPG user interface is displayed according to the event information read from the frequency point where the DC a channel belongs, wherein the window of the EPG user interface plays the broadcast program a1 of the DC a channel, as shown in the window of the area 23 in Fig.2. If the DC a channel and the corresponding barker channel are not at the same frequency point, then the first variable is set to be true, and the channel switch interface is called to switch to the barker channel; meanwhile, the channel identifier (for example channel id) of the DC a channel is recorded in the second variable in case the DC a channel needs to be switched back according to the channel identifier when exiting the EPG user interface; and the EPG user interface is displayed according to the event information of the barker channel, the window of the EPG user interface plays the broadcast program of the barker channel, as shown in the window of the area 23 in Fig. 5.If no corresponding barker channel exists, the EPG user interface is directly displayed according to the event information read from the frequency point where the DC a channel belongs, and a broadcast program a1 of the DC a channel is played in a window of the EPG user interface, as shown in a window of the area 23 in Fig.2.When exiting the EPG user interface, whether the first variable is false is determined at first. If the first variable is false, the TV goes back directly to the current channel. If the first variable is true, the channel switch interface is called to switch back to the current channel indicated by the channel identifier according to the channel identifier recorded in the second variable after exiting from the EPG user interface; and after the TV is successfully switched to the current channel, the first variable is set to be false.In order to implement the above method, the present disclosure provides a display device, wherein the device includes:a display screen for displaying broadcast programs of a current channel;a memory configured to store computer instructions and data associated with display content of the display screen;

anddisplaying the EPG user interface processed by a video display processor on the broadcast program image of the current channel on the display screen so as to ensure a complete display of the EPG user interface;
